## CMU Pronunciation symbols

The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (CMUdict) is a widely used phonetic dictionary for American English that maps words to their pronunciations in Arpabet notation. Arpabet is a phonetic transcription code developed by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and represents English phonemes using ASCII characters. It's frequently used in speech processing and text-to-speech (TTS) systems.
