Dear New Members,
Welcome to Rock Climbing Club and hope you will get 
the most out of this rewarding sport. As beginners, you 
may be nervous in anticipation of your first climb. Many of 
you have asked about what climbing equipment to buy, 
such as boots, ropes, helmets, and gloves. You don’t have 
to bother yourself with these concerns. We offer a special 
service that will rent you all the equipment you will ever 
need for climbing. The rental service is always available 
for our members. Just come on Saturday, ask for the rental 
service, and be ready to have a fun climb. I look forward to 
seeing you all this Saturday at 9 a.m. 
Sincerely, 
John B. Snyder

19. 다음 글에 드러난 Rachel의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Rachel loved watching birds in the woods. However, she was 
confined to the house because of a broken leg. She turned on 
the TV but nothing was interesting. She tried to read a book but 
it was not fun at all. All she could do was sit, look at her broken 
leg, and watch the clock. As she was listening to the dull 
tick-tock of the clock, her phone vibrated. It was a message 
with an audio file from her dad. As she opened it, a huge smile 
spread across her face. Her dad had sent a recording of a little 
wren’s song ― her favorite bird song. Listening to the bright 
warm sounds lifted her spirits and made her day more pleasant.
* wren: 굴뚝새
① bored
→ delighted
② confident
→ nervous 
③ pleased → upset
④ frightened → relieved
⑤ calm

Unless your company offers a class on how to give and 
receive feedback, don’t assume those around you, including 
your boss, know how to give negative feedback. They may be 
too aggressive. Too direct. Maybe even a little mean. Perhaps 
they are bad at giving feedback because no one ever taught 
them how. Or perhaps they’ve had bosses who were bad at 
giving them feedback. Try to brush aside the stuff that offends 
or upsets you to really try to hear what they are saying you can 
do better next time. And if they only tell you things like, 
“don’t let that happen again,” then work to figure out what 
you can do better next time, so that it doesn’t actually happen 
again. Preparing to solve a problem for next time feels better 
than getting upset about our failure to solve it this time.

21. 밑줄 친 a cage model이 다음 글에서 의미하는 바로 가장 
적절한 것은? [3점]
For a long time, tourism was seen as a huge monster 
invading the areas of indigenous peoples, introducing them to 
the evils of the modern world. However, research has shown 
that this is not the correct way to perceive it. In most places, 
tourists are welcome and indigenous people see tourism as a 
path to modernity and economic development. But such 
development is always a two-edged sword. Tourism can mean 
progress, but most often also means the loss of traditions and 
cultural uniqueness. And, of course, there are examples of 
‘cultural pollution’, ‘vulgarization’ and ‘phony-folk-cultures’. 
The background for such characteristics is often more or less 
romantic and the normative ideas of a former or prevailing 
authenticity. Ideally (to some) there should exist ancient cultures 
for modern consumers to gaze at, or even step into for a while, 
while travelling or on holiday. This is a cage model that is 
difficult to defend in a global world where we all, indigenous 
or not, are part of the same social fabric. 
* indigenous: 토착의  ** vulgarization: 상스럽게 함
① preserving a past culture in its original form for consumption
② restoring local cultural heritages that have long been neglected
③ limiting public access to prehistoric sites for conservation
④ confining tourism research to authentic cultural traditions
⑤ maintaining a budget for cultural policies and regulations

While genetic advancements are often reported as 
environmentally dependent or modest in effect size in 
academic publications, these are often translated to the public 
in deterministic language through the media. Sociologists of 
genetics argue that media portrayals of genetic influences on 
health have increased considerably over time, becoming part 
of the public discourse through which individuals understand 
symptoms, make help-seeking decisions, and form views of 
people with particular traits or conditions. The media is the 
primary source of information about genetic advances and 
their applications, but it does not provide a neutral discourse. 
Rather, information is selectively included or ignored, and 
scientific and clinical implications of genetic discoveries are 
often inaccurate or overstated. This “genetic optimism” has 
influenced public opinion, and research suggests that ordinary 
people are largely accepting of genetic explanations for health 
and behavior and tend to overestimate the heritability of 
common diseases for biological relatives.

23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Libraries are becoming increasingly interested in the 
services they are providing for their users. This is an important 
focus ― especially as more and more information becomes 
available electronically. However, the traditional strengths of 
libraries have always been their collections. This is true still 
today ― especially in research libraries. Also, collection makeup 
is the hardest thing to change quickly. For example, if a library 
has a long tradition of heavily collecting materials published in 
Mexico, then even if that library stops purchasing all Mexican 
imprints, its Mexican collection will still be large and 
impressive for several years to come unless they start 
withdrawing books. Likewise, if a library has not collected 
much in a subject, and then decides to start collecting heavily 
in that area it will take several years for the collection to be 
large enough and rich enough to be considered an important 
research tool.
① lasting significance of library collections even in the digital age 
② changing roles of local libraries and their effects on society
③ growing needs for analyzing a large volume of library data 
④ online services as a key to the success of research libraries
⑤ rare book collectors’ contributions to a library’s reputation
24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
From the late nineteenth century on, the dullness found in the 
senile, their isolation and withdrawal, their clinging to the past 
and lack of interest in worldly affairs were characteristically 
represented as the symptoms of senility ― the social shame of the 
inevitable deterioration of the brain. Following World War II, 
academic discourse on aging typically represented these as the 
causes of senility. The location of senile mental deterioration 
was no longer the aging brain but a society that, through 
involuntary retirement, social isolation, and the loosening of 
traditional family ties, stripped the elderly of the roles that had 
sustained meaning in their lives. When elderly people were 
deprived of these meaningful social roles, when they became 
increasingly isolated and were cut off from the interests and 
activities that had earlier occupied them, not surprisingly their 
mental functioning deteriorated. The elderly did not so much 
lose their minds as lose their place.

Note: Respondents had to choose one of the three options listed above for 
each location. Due to rounding, the percentages may not sum to 100%.
The three pie charts above show the percentages of 
American adults’ responses to a survey conducted in 2017. 
The survey asked whether people should be allowed to fly 
drones at three locations: public parks, beaches, and near 
people’s homes. ① While 44% of the respondents said people 
should be allowed to fly drones in public parks, 25% said 
people should not be allowed to do so. ② When asked if 
people should be allowed to fly drones on beaches, 35% of the 
respondents said it should be allowed and 32% said it should 
not. ③ More than half of the respondents said people should 
not be allowed to fly drones near people’s homes. ④ Less 
than 10% of the respondents said people should be allowed to 
fly drones near people’s homes. ⑤ For each of the three 
locations, the proportion of the respondents who chose “It 
depends” is above 30%.

Born in 1927 in Cleveland, Ohio, Carl Stokes had a hard 
time early in his life. When he was a young child, his father 
died. As he grew up, he held many odd jobs to help his family. 
Stokes graduated from Cleveland-Marshall College of Law 
and passed the bar exam. He established a law firm in 1962. A 
few years later, he ran for Mayor of Cleveland and lost, but he 
entered the race again in the next election and won. He 
became the first African-American mayor of the city. After 
retiring from politics, he moved to New York City and became 
a TV news anchor. Later in his life, he was appointed the U.S. 
Ambassador to the Republic of Seychelles. His amazing life 
finally came to an end in his birth city in 1996.

29. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
To begin with a psychological reason, the knowledge of 
another’s personal affairs can tempt the possessor of this 
information ① to repeat it as gossip because as unrevealed 
information it remains socially inactive. Only when the 
information is repeated can its possessor ② turn the fact that 
he knows something into something socially valuable like 
social recognition, prestige, and notoriety. As long as he keeps 
his information to ③ himself, he may feel superior to those 
who do not know it. But knowing and not telling does not 
give him that feeling of “superiority that, so to say, latently 
contained in the secret, fully ④ actualizing itself only at the 
moment of disclosure.” This is the main motive for gossiping 
about well-known figures and superiors. The gossip producer 
assumes that some of the “fame” of the subject of gossip, as 
⑤ whose “friend” he presents himself, will rub off on him.
* prestige: 명성  ** notoriety: 악명  *** latently: 잠재적으로

One misconception that often appears in the writings of 
physical scientists who are looking at biology from the outside 
is that the environment appears to them to be a static entity, 
which cannot contribute new bits of information as evolution 
progresses. This, however, is by no means the case. Far from 
being static, the environment is constantly changing and 
offering new ① challenges to evolving populations. For higher 
organisms, the most significant changes in the environment 
are those produced by the contemporaneous evolution of other 
organisms. The evolution of a horse’s hoof from a five-toed 
foot has ② enabled the horse to gallop rapidly over open 
plains. But such galloping is of no ③ advantage to a horse 
unless it is being chased by a predator. The horse’s efficient 
mechanism for running would never have evolved except for 
the fact that meat-eating predators were at the same time 
evolving more efficient methods of ④ attack. Consequently, 
laws based upon ecological relationships among different 
kinds of organisms are ⑤ optional for understanding evolution 
and the diversity of life to which it has given rise. 
* hoof: 발굽  ** gallop: 질주하다  *** predator: 포식자

31. When you begin to tell a story again that you have retold 
many times, what you retrieve from memory is the index to 
the story itself. That index can be embellished in a variety of 
ways. Over time, even the embellishments become standardized. 
An old man’s story that he has told hundreds of times shows 
little variation, and any variation that does exist becomes part 
of the story itself, regardless of its origin. People add details to 
their stories that may or may not have occurred. They are 
recalling indexes and reconstructing details. If at some point 
they add a nice detail, not really certain of its validity, telling 
the story with that same detail a few more times will ensure its 
permanent place in the story index. In other words, the stories 
we tell time and again are 
 to the memory we 
have of the events that the story relates. 
* retrieve: 회수하다  ** embellish: 윤색하다
① identical
② beneficial
③ alien
④ prior
⑤ neutral
32. With population growth slowing, the strongest force 
increasing demand for more agricultural production will be 
rising incomes, which are desired by practically all 
governments and individuals. Although richer people spend 
smaller proportions of their income on food, in total they 
consume more food ― and richer food, which contributes to 
various kinds of disease and debilitation. The changes in 
diet that usually accompany higher incomes will require 
relatively greater increases in the production of feed grains, 
rather than food grains, as foods of animal origin partly 
. It takes two to 
six times more grain to produce food value through animals 
than to get the equivalent value directly from plants. It is thus 
quite credible to estimate that in order to meet economic and 
social needs within the next three to five decades, the world 
should be producing more than twice as much grain and 
agricultural products as at present, but in ways that these are 
accessible to the food-insecure.
* debilitation: 건강 악화
① displace plant-based foods in people’s diets
② demand eco-friendly processing systems
③ cause several nutritional imbalances
④ indicate the consumers’ higher social status 
⑤ play an important role in population growth

33. If one looks at the Oxford definition, one gets the sense that 
post-truth is not so much a claim that truth does not exist as 
that facts are subordinate to our political point of view. The 
Oxford definition focuses on “what” post-truth is: the idea that 
feelings sometimes matter more than facts. But just as 
important is the next question, which is why this ever occurs. 
Someone does not argue against an obvious or easily 
confirmable fact for no reason; he or she does so when it is to 
his or her advantage. When a person’s beliefs are threatened by 
an “inconvenient fact,” sometimes it is preferable to challenge 
the fact. This can happen at either a conscious or unconscious 
level (since sometimes the person we are seeking to convince 
is ourselves), but the point is that this sort of post-truth 
relationship to facts occurs only when we are seeking to assert 
something 
. [3점]
* subordinate: 종속하는
① to hold back our mixed feelings 
② that balances our views on politics
③ that leads us to give way to others in need
④ to carry the constant value of absolute truth
⑤ that is more important to us than the truth itself
34. The debates between social and cultural anthropologists 
concern not the differences between the concepts but the 
analytical priority: which should come first, the social chicken 
or the cultural egg? British anthropology emphasizes the social. 
It assumes that social institutions determine culture and that 
universal domains of society (such as kinship, economy, politics, 
and religion) are represented by specific institutions (such as the 
family, subsistence farming, the British Parliament, and the 
Church of England) which can be compared cross-culturally. 
American anthropology emphasizes the cultural. It assumes that 
culture shapes social institutions by providing the shared 
beliefs, the core values, the communicative tools, and so on that 
make social life possible. It does not assume that there are 
universal social domains, preferring instead to discover 
domains empirically as aspects of each society’s own 
classificatory schemes ― in other words, its culture. And it 
rejects the notion that any social institution can be understood 
. [3점]
* anthropology: 인류학  ** subsistence farming: 자급 농업
*** empirically: 경험적으로
① in relation to its cultural origin
② in isolation from its own context
③ regardless of personal preferences
④ without considering its economic roots
⑤ on the basis of British-American relations

Much of what we do each day is automatic and guided by 
habit, requiring little conscious awareness, and that’s not a bad 
thing. As Duhigg explains, our habits are necessary mental 
energy savers. ① We need to relieve our conscious minds so 
we can solve new problems as they come up. ② Once we’ve 
solved the puzzle of how to ballroom dance, for example, we 
can do it by habit, and so be mentally freed to focus on a 
conversation while dancing instead. ③ But try to talk when 
first learning to dance the tango, and it’s a disaster ― we need 
our conscious attention to focus on the steps. ④ Tango 
musicians bring different genres of music together to attract a 
more diverse audience from varying backgrounds. ⑤ Imagine 
how little we’d accomplish if we had to focus consciously on 
every behavior ― e.g., on where to place our feet for each step 
we take.

A sovereign state is usually defined as one whose 
citizens are free to determine their own affairs without 
interference from any agency beyond its territorial borders.
(A) No citizen could be a full member of the community so 
long as she was tied to ancestral traditions with which the 
community might wish to break ― the problem of Antigone 
in Sophocles’ tragedy. Sovereignty and citizenship thus 
require not only borders in space, but also borders in time.
(B) Sovereignty and citizenship require freedom from the past 
at least as much as freedom from contemporary powers. 
No state could be sovereign if its inhabitants lacked the 
ability to change a course of action adopted by their 
forefathers in the past, or even one to which they once 
committed themselves.
(C) But freedom in space (and limits on its territorial extent) is 
merely one characteristic of sovereignty. Freedom in time 
(and limits on its temporal extent) is equally important and 
probably more fundamental. [3점]

Because a main goal of science is to discover lawful 
relationships, science assumes that what is being investigated 
is lawful. For example, the chemist assumes that chemical 
reactions are lawful, and the physicist assumes that the 
physical world is lawful.
(A) The determinist, then, assumes that everything that occurs 
is a function of a finite number of causes and that, if these 
causes were known, an event could be predicted with 
complete accuracy. However, knowing all causes of an 
event is not necessary; the determinist simply assumes 
that they exist and that as more causes are known, 
predictions become more accurate.
(B) The assumption that what is being studied can be understood 
in terms of causal laws is called determinism. Richard 
Taylor defined determinism as the philosophical doctrine 
that “states that for everything that ever happens there are 
conditions such that, given them, nothing else could happen.”
(C) For example, almost everyone would agree that the weather 
is a function of a finite number of variables such as sunspots, 
high-altitude jet streams, and barometric pressure; yet 
weather forecasts are always probabilistic because many of 
these variables change constantly, and others are simply 
unknown.

The field of international politics is, however, dominated 
by states and other powerful actors (such as multinational 
corporations) that have priorities other than human rights.
 
There is obviously a wide gap between the promises of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the real 
world of human-rights violations. In so far as we sympathize 
with the victims, we may criticize the UN and its member 
governments for failing to keep their promises. ( ① ) 
However, we cannot understand the gap between human-rights 
ideals and the real world of human-rights violations by 
sympathy or by legal analysis. ( ② ) Rather, it requires 
investigation by the various social sciences of the causes of 
social conflict and political oppression, and of the interaction 
between national and international politics. ( ③ ) The UN 
introduced the concept of human rights into international law 
and politics. ( ④ ) It is a leading feature of the human-rights 
field that the governments of the world proclaim human rights 
but have a highly variable record of implementing them. ( ⑤ ) 
We must understand why this is so.

So, there was a social pressure for art to come up with 
some vocation that both distinguished it from science and, 
at the same time, made it equal in stature to science. 
Representational theories of art treat the work of the artist as 
similar to that of the scientist. Both, so to speak, are involved in 
describing the external world. ( ① ) But by the nineteenth 
century, any comparison between the scientist and the artist 
was bound to make the artist look like a poor relation in terms 
of making discoveries about the world or holding a mirror up to 
nature. ( ② ) Here, science clearly had the edge. ( ③ ) The 
notion that art specialized in the expression of the emotions 
was particularly attractive in this light. ( ④ ) It rendered unto 
science its own ― the exploration of the objective world ― while 
saving something comparably important for art to do ― to 
explore the inner world of feeling. ( ⑤ ) If science held the 
mirror up to nature, art turned a mirror at the self and its 
experiences. [3점]

Over the past few decades, architecture as an idea and 
practice has increasingly limited its definition of itself. In 
the foreseeable future, the instrumentality of architecture in 
effecting actual change ― that is, change that challenges 
the dominance of commercial institutions, their aims, and 
values ― will diminish. While the present day seems to be 
a time of unparalleled innovation and freedom of choice, 
the reality is that architectural styles and forms are often the 
attractive packaging and repackaging of the same proven, 
marketable concepts. The speed with which “radical” 
designs by celebrity architects achieve acceptance and 
popularity demonstrates that formal innovation has itself 
become an important commodity. However, beneath the 
cloak of radicalism, the conventions of existing building 
typologies and programs, with all their comforting 
familiarity, still rule ― and sell. What is needed desperately 
today are approaches to architecture that can free its

Much of our knowledge of the biology of the oceans is 
derived from “blind” sampling. We use instruments to measure 
bulk properties of the environment, such as salinity and 
temperature, and we use bottle or net samples to (a) extract 
knowledge about the organisms living in the ocean. This kind 
of approach has contributed important knowledge but has also 
influenced the way we view marine life. It leads us to focus on 
abundances, production rates, and distribution patterns. Such a 
perspective is very (b) relevant in the context of the ocean as a 
resource for fisheries. It is also helpful in developing an 
understanding of biogeochemical issues such as ocean carbon 
fluxes. But on its own, this approach is (c) insufficient, even 
for those purposes. The kind of intuition that we develop 
about marine life is, of course, influenced by the way we 
(d) observe it. Because the ocean is inaccessible to us and most 
planktonic organisms are microscopic, our intuition is elementary 
compared, for example, to the intuitive understanding we have 
about (macroscopic) terrestrial life. Our understanding of the 
biology of planktonic organisms is still based mainly on 
examinations of (dead) individuals, field samples, and 
incubation experiments, and even our sampling may be 
severely biased toward those organisms that are not destroyed

(A)
Nancy and her daughter, Carol, were at the Eiffel Tower, as 
the sun was setting over Paris. The sunset that they saw was 
beyond description. “Thank you, Carol. I can’t believe I am 
in Paris with you. It has been my lifelong dream to visit this 
beautiful city.” Nancy thanked her daughter for this special 
trip that she had prepared in secret. Their trip to France was 
Carol’s surprise gift for the sixtieth birthday of her mother ―
a woman who had sacrificed all (a) her life for her only 
daughter. 
(B)
While they were enjoying dessert, a server approached 
them and asked, “Excuse me, who is Nancy Holloway 
between the two of you?” “I am,” answered Nancy with a 
curious look. Then he gave a lovely bouquet of roses to 
Nancy, saying, “This gift is from your daughter. (b) She 
called yesterday and asked us to prepare this celebration for 
you.” Surprised, she looked at her smiling daughter. Carol 
winked and said, “(c) You deserve this and more, Mom. 
Thank you for everything you have ever done for me.”
(C)
When at last they arrived at the restaurant, to make matters 
worse, they were charged three times more than the usual 
fare due to the heavy traffic. Yet a happy turn of events was 
waiting for them. The restaurant was fantastic and all the 
staff were very polite and kind. The French cuisine was 
delicious. “This is the best food (d) I have ever had! I will 
never forget this dinner with you,” said Nancy, thanking 
Carol for another surprise gift.
(D)
As the sky grew dark, Carol hurried because she had 
prepared another secret surprise for Nancy. “Mom, let’s go 
enjoy our dinner before it gets too late. I reserved a table at a 
French restaurant for (e) you.” Their pleasant evening, however, 
was unexpectedly interrupted as they waited to get a taxi. It 
took them a really long time to catch one. Even after they 
finally got in, the taxi got caught in heavy traffic. They were 
late for their reservation.
