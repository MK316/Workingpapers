Dear Future Pilots,
We are very excited to announce that we will offer the 
Summer Aviation Flight Camp for student pilot certificates. 
It will be held from July 20 to August 3, 2019 at O’Ryan 
Flight School. The summer camp will include programs 
in which participants can receive flight instruction from 
professional pilots, go on field trips, try flight simulators, 
and do a lot more. Because of the aviation regulation for 
student pilots, the camp is limited to participants over 16 
years old. Please see the attached document for registration 
and tuition information. If you have further questions about 
the camp, please contact the coordinator at 714-3127-1004. 
Sincerely,
Todd O’Ryan 
Director

19. 다음 글에 드러난 Claire의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
It was two hours before the paper submission. With the 
deadline close at hand, Claire was still struggling with her 
writing. Pressed for time and stuck in a deadlock, she had no 
idea how to finish the paper. She wasn’t even sure whether she 
could submit it on time. What she found in her paper was 
scribbled words, half sentences, and a pile of seemingly strange 
and disjointed ideas. “Nothing makes sense,” she said to herself. 
She looked at her writing and began reading it over and over. 
All of a sudden and unexpectedly, something was found in 
that pile of thoughts: the flow and connection of ideas she had 
not considered while she was writing. From this moment, the 
ticking of the clock sounded encouraging to her. “Yes, I can do 
it!” Claire said as she grabbed her pencil again.
* scribble: 휘갈겨 쓰다

② relieved

③ nervous

④ indifferent → excited

20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Learning a certain concept such as “molecules” requires 
more than just a single exposure to the idea. If a student is 
going to remember a science concept, he or she should 
experience it multiple times and in various contexts. That is 
one of the strengths of the learning cycle: the students have 
direct experience with the concept, then they talk about it, and 
then they have even more direct experience. Reading, watching 
videos, and listening to others’ thoughts contribute to a more 
solid understanding of the concept. This suggests more than 
repetition. Each event allows the student to examine the 
concept from a different perspective. Ultimately this will lead 
to a substantive, useful understanding of the complexities and 
nuances of the concept.

21. 밑줄 친 “Garbage in, garbage out”이 다음 글에서 의미하는 
바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Many companies confuse activities and results. As a 
consequence, they make the mistake of designing a process 
that sets out milestones in the form of activities that must be 
carried out during the sales cycle. Salespeople have a genius 
for doing what’s compensated rather than what’s effective. If 
your process has an activity such as “submit proposal” or 
“make cold call,” then that’s just what your people will do. No 
matter that the calls were to the wrong customer or went 
nowhere. No matter that the proposal wasn’t submitted at the 
right point in the buying decision or contained inappropriate 
information. The process asked for activity, and activity was 
what it got. Salespeople have done what was asked for. 
“Garbage in, garbage out” they will delight in telling you. “It’s 
not our problem, it’s this dumb process.” 
① In seeking results, compensation is the key to quality.
② Salespeople should join in a decision-making process.
③ Shared understanding does not always result in success.
④ Activities drawn from false information produce failure.
⑤ Processes focused on activities end up being ineffective.

The twenty-first century is the age of information and 
knowledge. It is a century that is characterized by knowledge as 
the important resource that gains competitive advantage for 
companies. To acquire all these knowledge and information, 
organizations must rely on the data that they store. Data, the 
basic element, is gathered daily from different input sources. 
Information is extracted or learned from these sources of data, 
and this captured information is then transformed into knowledge 
that is eventually used to trigger actions or decisions. By and 
large, organizations do not have any problem of not having 
enough data because most organizations are rich with data. The 
problem however is that many organizations are poor in 
information and knowledge. This fact translates into one of the 
biggest challenges faced by organizations: how to transform raw 
data into information and eventually into knowledge, which if 
exploited correctly provides the capabilities to predict customers’ 
behaviour and business trends.

23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
In the twelfth to thirteenth centuries there appeared the first 
manuals teaching “table manners” to the offspring of aristocrats. 
It was a genre that subsequently had a great success in the 
early modern period with The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione, 
The Galateo by Monsignor Della Casa, and many others 
produced in different European countries. In a variety of ways 
and meanings, these are all instruments intended to define or 
distinguish who is in from who is out, separating the participants 
from the ostracized. It is for this reason that manuals of “good 
manners” addressed to the aristocracy always have a negative 
reference to the peasant who behaves badly, who “doesn’t 
know” what the rules are, and for this reason is excluded from 
the lordly table. Food etiquette had become a sign of social 
barriers and of the impossibility of breaking them down.
* aristocrat: 귀족  ** ostracize: 추방하다
① table manners as a marker for class distinction
② publications to bring about equality between classes
③ unintended effects of distinguishing insiders from outsiders
④ attempts to elaborate food etiquette for educational purposes
⑤ roles of manners in uniting people from different backgrounds
24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
Racial and ethnic relations in the United States are better 
today than in the past, but many changes are needed before 
sports are a model of inclusion and fairness. The challenges 
today are different from the ones faced twenty years ago, and 
experience shows that when current challenges are met, a new 
social situation is created in which new challenges emerge. 
For example, once racial and ethnic segregation is eliminated 
and people come together, they must learn to live, work, and 
play with each other despite diverse experiences and cultural 
perspectives. Meeting this challenge requires a commitment to 
equal treatment, plus learning about the perspectives of others, 
understanding how they define and give meaning to the world, 
and then determining how to form and maintain relationships 
while respecting differences, making compromises, and 
supporting one another in the pursuit of goals that may not 
always be shared. None of this is easy, and challenges are 
never met once and for all time.
* segregation: 분리
① On-going Challenges in Sports: Racial and Ethnic Issues
② Racial and Ethnic Injustice in Sports: Cause and Effect
③ The History of Racial and Ethnic Diversity in Sports
④ All for One, One for All: The Power of Team Sports

Along the coast of British Columbia lies a land of forest 
green and sparkling blue. This land is the Great Bear 
Rainforest, which measures 6.4 million hectares ― about the 
size of Ireland or Nova Scotia. It is home to a wide variety of 
wildlife. One of the unique animals living in the area is the 
Kermode bear. It is a rare kind of bear known to be the official 
mammal of British Columbia. Salmon are also found here. 
They play a vital role in this area’s ecosystem as a wide range 
of animals, as well as humans, consume them. The Great Bear 
Rainforest is also home to the Western Red Cedar, a tree that 
can live for several hundred years. The tree’s wood is 
lightweight and rot-resistant, so it is used for making buildings 
and furniture.

29. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은? [3점]
An interesting aspect of human psychology is that we tend to 
like things more and find them more ① appealing if everything 
about those things is not obvious the first time we experience 
them. This is certainly true in music. For example, we might 
hear a song on the radio for the first time that catches our interest 
and ② decide we like it. Then the next time we hear it, we hear 
a lyric we didn’t catch the first time, or we might notice ③ what 
the piano or drums are doing in the background. A special 
harmony ④ emerges that we missed before. We hear more and 
more and understand more and more with each listening. 
Sometimes, the longer ⑤ that takes for a work of art to reveal 
all of its subtleties to us, the more fond of that thing ― whether 
it’s music, art, dance, or architecture ― we become.
* subtleties: 중요한 세부 요소[사항]들

Sometimes the awareness that one is distrusted can provide 
the necessary incentive for self-reflection. An employee who 
① realizes she isn’t being trusted by her co-workers with 
shared responsibilities at work might, upon reflection, identify 
areas where she has consistently let others down or failed to 
follow through on previous commitments. Others’ distrust of 
her might then ② forbid her to perform her share of the duties 
in a way that makes her more worthy of their trust. But distrust 
of one who is ③ sincere in her efforts to be a trustworthy and 
dependable person can be disorienting and might cause her to 
doubt her own perceptions and to distrust herself. Consider, 
for instance, a teenager whose parents are ④ suspicious and 
distrustful when she goes out at night; even if she has been 
forthright about her plans and is not ⑤ breaking any 
agreed-upon rules, her identity as a respectable moral subject 
is undermined by a pervasive parental attitude that expects 
deceit and betrayal. 
* forthright: 솔직한, 거리낌 없는  ** pervasive: 널리 스며 있는

31. Some people have defined wildlife damage management as 
the science and management of overabundant species, but this 
definition is too narrow. All wildlife species act in ways that 
harm human interests. Thus, all species cause wildlife damage, 
not just overabundant ones. One interesting example of this 
involves endangered peregrine falcons in California, which 
prey on another endangered species, the California least tern. 
Certainly, we would not consider peregrine falcons as being 
overabundant, but we wish that they would not feed on an 
endangered species. In this case, one of the negative values 
associated with a peregrine falcon population is that its 
predation reduces the population of another endangered 
species. The goal of wildlife damage management in this case 
would be to stop the falcons from eating the terns without 
 the falcons.

② harming
③ training
④ overfeeding

32. Through recent decades academic archaeologists have been 
urged to conduct their research and excavations according to 
hypothesis-testing procedures. It has been argued that we should 
construct our general theories, deduce testable propositions and 
prove or disprove them against the sampled data. In fact, the 
application of this ‘scientific method’ often ran into difficulties. 
The data have a tendency to lead to unexpected questions, 
problems and issues. Thus, archaeologists claiming to follow 
hypothesis-testing procedures found themselves having to create 
a fiction. In practice, their work and theoretical conclusions 
partly developed 
. 
In other words, they already knew the data when they decided 
upon an interpretation. But in presenting their work they rewrote 
the script, placing the theory first and claiming to have tested it 
against data which they discovered, as in an experiment under 
laboratory conditions.
* excavation: 발굴  ** deduce: 추론하다
① from the data which they had discovered
② from comparisons of data in other fields
③ to explore more sites for their future studies
④ by supposing possible theoretical frameworks
⑤ by observing the hypothesis-testing procedures

33. Digital 
technology 
accelerates 
dematerialization 
by 
hastening the migration from products to services. The liquid 
nature of services means they don’t have to be bound to 
materials. But dematerialization is not just about digital goods. 
The reason even solid physical goods ― like a soda can ― can 
deliver more benefits while inhabiting less material is because 
their heavy atoms are substituted by weightless bits. The 
tangible is replaced by intangibles ― intangibles like better 
design, innovative processes, smart chips, and eventually online 
connectivity ― that do the work that more aluminum atoms 
used to do. Soft things, like intelligence, are thus embedded into 
hard things, like aluminum, that make hard things behave more 
like software. Material goods infused with bits increasingly act 
as if 
. Nouns morph to verbs. 
Hardware behaves like software. In Silicon Valley they say it 
like this: “Software eats everything.” [3점]
* morph: 변화하다
① they were intangible services
② they replaced all digital goods 
③ hardware could survive software 
④ digital services were not available
⑤ software conflicted with hardware
34. Not all Golden Rules are alike; two kinds emerged over 
time. The negative version instructs restraint; the positive 
encourages intervention. One sets a baseline of at least not 
causing harm; the other points toward aspirational or idealized 
beneficent behavior. While examples of these rules abound, too 
many to list exhaustively, let these versions suffice for our 
purpose here: “What is hateful to you do not do to another” and 
“Love another as yourself.” Both versions insist on caring for 
others, whether through acts of omission, such as not injuring, or 
through acts of commission, by actively intervening. Yet while 
these Golden Rules encourage an agent to care for an other, 
they 
. 
The purposeful displacement of concern away from the ego 
nonetheless remains partly self-referential. Both the negative 
and the positive versions invoke the ego as the fundamental 
measure against which behaviors are to be evaluated. [3점]
* an other: 타자(他者)
① do not lead the self to act on concerns for others
② reveal inner contradiction between the two versions
③ fail to serve as a guide when faced with a moral dilemma
④ do not require abandoning self-concern altogether
⑤ hardly consider the benefits of social interactions

When a dog is trained to detect drugs, explosives, contraband, 
or other items, the trainer doesn’t actually teach the dog how 
to smell; the dog already knows how to discriminate one scent 
from another. Rather, the dog is trained to become emotionally 
aroused by one smell versus another. ① In the step-by-step 
training process, the trainer attaches an “emotional charge” to 
a particular scent so that the dog is drawn to it above all 
others. ② And then the dog is trained to search out the desired 
item on cue, so that the trainer can control or release the 
behavior. ③ This emotional arousal is also why playing tug 
with a dog is a more powerful emotional reward in a training 
regime than just giving a dog a food treat, since the trainer 
invests more emotion into a game of tug. ④ As long as the 
trainer gives the dog a food reward regularly, the dog can 
understand its “good” behavior results in rewards. ⑤ From a 
dog’s point of view, the tug toy is compelling because the 
trainer is “upset” by the toy.
* contraband: 밀수품  ** tug: 잡아당김

Notation was more than a practical method for preserving 
an expanding repertoire of music. 
(A) Written notes freeze the music rather than allowing it to 
develop in the hands of individuals, and it discourages 
improvisation. Partly because of notation, modern classical 
performance lacks the depth of nuance that is part of aural 
tradition. Before notation arrived, in all history music was 
largely carried on as an aural tradition. 
(B) It changed the nature of the art itself. To write something 
down means that people far away in space and time can 
re-create it. At the same time, there are downsides. 
(C) Most world music is still basically aural, including 
sophisticated musical traditions such as Indian and Balinese. 
Most jazz musicians can read music but often don’t bother, 
and their art is much involved with improvisation. Many 
modern pop musicians, one example being Paul McCartney, 
can’t read music at all.

Marshall McLuhan, among others, noted that clothes are 
people’s extended skin, wheels extended feet, camera and 
telescopes extended eyes. Our technological creations are 
great extrapolations of the bodies that our genes build. 
(A) The blueprints for our shells spring from our minds, which 
may spontaneously create something none of our ancestors 
ever made or even imagined. If technology is an extension 
of humans, it is not an extension of our genes but of our 
minds. Technology is therefore the extended body for ideas.
(B) In this way, we can think of technology as our extended 
body. During the industrial age it was easy to see the world 
this way. Steam-powered shovels, locomotives, television, 
and the levers and gears of engineers were a fabulous 
exoskeleton that turned man into superman.
(C) A closer look reveals the flaw in this analogy: The extended 
costume of animals is the result of their genes. They inherit 
the basic blueprints of what they make. Humans don’t. [3점]

Rather, happiness is often found in those moments we are 
most vulnerable, alone or in pain. 
We seek out feel-good experiences, always on the lookout for 
the next holiday, purchase or culinary experience. This approach 
to happiness is relatively recent; it depends on our capacity both 
to pad our lives with material pleasures and to feel that we can 
control our suffering. ( ① ) Painkillers, as we know them today, 
are a relatively recent invention and access to material comfort is 
now within reach of a much larger proportion of the world’s 
population. ( ② ) These technological and economic advances 
have had significant cultural implications, leading us to see our 
negative experiences as a problem and maximizing our positive 
experiences as the answer. ( ③ ) Yet, through this we have 
forgotten that being happy in life is not just about pleasure. ( ④ ) 
Comfort, contentment and satisfaction have never been the elixir 
of happiness. ( ⑤ ) Happiness is there, on the edges of these 
experiences, and when we get a glimpse of that kind of happiness 
it is powerful, transcendent and compelling.

That puts you each near a focus, a special point at which 
the sound of your voice gets focused as it reflects off the 
passageway’s curved walls and ceiling.
Whispering galleries are remarkable acoustic spaces found 
beneath certain domes or curved ceilings. A famous one is 
located outside a well-known restaurant in New York City’s 
Grand Central Station. ( ① ) It’s a fun place to take a date: 
the two of you can exchange romantic words while you’re 
forty feet apart and separated by a busy passageway. ( ② ) 
You’ll hear each other clearly, but the passersby won’t hear a 
word you’re saying. ( ③ ) To produce this effect, the two of 
you should stand at diagonally opposite corners of the space, 
facing the wall. ( ④ ) Ordinarily, the sound waves you 
produce travel in all directions and bounce off the walls at 
different times and places, scrambling them so much that they 
are inaudible when they arrive at the ear of a listener forty feet 
away. ( ⑤ ) But when you whisper at a focus, the reflected 
waves all arrive at the same time at the other focus, thus 
reinforcing one another and allowing your words to be heard.

After the United Nations environmental conference in 
Rio de Janeiro in 1992 made the term “sustainability” 
widely known around the world, the word became a 
popular buzzword by those who wanted to be seen as 
pro-environmental but who did not really intend to change 
their behavior. It became a public relations term, an 
attempt to be seen as abreast with the latest thinking of 
what we must do to save our planet from widespread harm. 
But then, in a decade or so, some governments, industries, 
educational institutions, and organizations started to use 
the term in a serious manner. In the United States a number 
of large corporations appointed a vice president for 
sustainability. Not only were these officials interested in 
how their companies could profit by producing “green” 
products, but they were often given the task of making the 
company more efficient by reducing wastes and pollution 
and by reducing its carbon emissions.

Aristotle did not think that all human beings should be 
allowed to engage in political activity: in his system, women, 
slaves, and foreigners were explicitly (a) excluded from the 
right to rule themselves and others. Nevertheless, his basic 
idea that politics is a unique collective activity that is directed 
at certain (b) common goals and ends still resonates today. 
But which ends? Many thinkers and political figures since 
the ancient world have developed different ideas about the 
goals that politics can or should achieve. This approach is 
known as political moralism.
For moralists, political life is a branch of ethics ― or moral 
philosophy ― so it is (c) unsurprising that there are many 
philosophers in the group of moralistic political thinkers. 
Political moralists argue that politics should be directed toward 
achieving substantial goals, or that political arrangements 
should be organized to (d) protect certain things. Among these 
things are political values such as justice, equality, liberty, 
happiness, fraternity, or national self-determination. At its 
most radical, moralism produces descriptions of ideal political 
societies known as Utopias, named after English statesman 
and philosopher Thomas More’s book Utopia, published in 
1516, which imagined an ideal nation. Utopian political 
thinking dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato’s 
book the Republic, but it is still used by modern thinkers such 
as Robert Nozick to explore ideas. Some theorists consider 
Utopian political thinking to be a (e) promising undertaking, 
since it has led in the past to justifications of totalitarian 
violence. However, at its best, Utopian thinking is part of a 
process of striving toward a better society, and many thinkers

(A)
When Master Brooks played a Mozart piece on the violin 
for his class to learn, the room was filled with waves of 
beautiful, soul-stirring sound. The class tried to emulate the 
music played by this renowned guest musician. Among the 
students in the class, Joe Brooks was by far the best. In fact, 
Joe was the master’s son. His father had placed a baby violin 
in his hands at the age of four, and Joe was a natural talent. 
Now, just twelve years later, he was already on (a) his way to 
becoming a virtuoso like his father.
* emulate: 열심히 배우다  ** virtuoso: 거장
(B)
When they finished practicing, Joe noticed his father 
standing in the corner. “Wow, that was quite wonderful,” he 
said with admiration. Master Brooks came toward his son. “I 
love the way you created those unique sounds while keeping 
the spirit of the violin. I underestimated the power that 
crossover music can create,” said Master Brooks to (b) him. 
Joe and his father returned home, both humming the melody 
that the band had been practicing.
(C)
“Well, did you get permission?” asked Brian as soon as Joe 
entered the practice room the following day. “Um, I’m not 
sure,” answered Joe without confidence. “(c) You can tell us 
about it after practice,” Brian said as he placed his fingers on 
the keyboard. Beside him, Nick was tuning his guitar. Joe 
thought that he would play just one last time before telling 
them that (d) he might pull out of the concert. The trio swung 
into their routine, as easily as only a group that had practiced 
long and hard together could.
(D)
After the class, Joe was alone with his father. He had 
something important to talk about. Joe took a deep breath and 
said, “I have been asked to play in a concert, and I would like 
your permission first. It is a crossover concert.” Master 
Brooks looked surprised. Indeed, the master’s dislike of 
crossover music was no secret. “Father,” Joe took a deep 
breath and continued, “I respect your views, but it is not what 
(e) you think. Why don’t you come and listen to our practice 
tomorrow? If you don’t like it, I will cancel.”
