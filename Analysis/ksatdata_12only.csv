2022,Context,Q40,"Philip Kitcher and Wesley Salmon have suggested that
there are two possible alternatives among philosophical
theories of explanation. One is the view that scientific
explanation consists in the unification of broad bodies of
phenomena under a minimal number of generalizations.
According to this view, the (or perhaps, a) goal of science
is to construct an economical framework of laws or
generalizations that are capable of subsuming all observable
phenomena. Scientific explanations organize and systematize
our knowledge of the empirical world; the more economical
the systematization, the deeper our understanding of what
is explained. The other view is the causal/mechanical
approach. According to it, a scientific explanation of a
phenomenon consists of uncovering the mechanisms that
produced the phenomenon of interest. This view sees the
explanation of individual events as primary, with the
explanation of generalizations flowing from them. That is,
the explanation of scientific generalizations comes from
the causal mechanisms that produce the regularities."
2021,Context,Q40,"From a cross-cultural perspective the equation between
public leadership and dominance is questionable. What does
one mean by dominance? Does it indicate coercion? Or
control over the most valued? Political systems may be
about both, either, or conceivably neither. The idea of
control would be a bothersome one for many peoples, as
for instance among many native peoples of Amazonia where
all members of a community are fond of their personal
autonomy and notably allergic to any obvious expression of
control or coercion. The conception of political power as a
coercive force, while it may be a Western fixation, is not a
universal. It is very unusual for an Amazonian leader to give
an order. If many peoples do not view political power as a
coercive force, nor as the most valued domain, then the leap
from the political to domination (as coercion), and from
there to domination of women, is a shaky one. As Marilyn
Strathern has remarked, the notions of the political and
political personhood are cultural obsessions of our own, a
bias long reflected in anthropological constructs."
2020,Context,Q40,"Biological organisms, including human societies both with
and without market systems, discount distant outputs over
those available at the present time based on risks associated
with an uncertain future. As the timing of inputs and outputs
varies greatly depending on the type of energy, there is a
strong case to incorporate time when assessing energy
alternatives. For example, the energy output from solar panels
or wind power engines, where most investment happens
before they begin producing, may need to be assessed
differently when compared to most fossil fuel extraction
technologies, where a large proportion of the energy output
comes much sooner, and a larger (relative) proportion of
inputs is applied during the extraction process, and not
upfront. Thus fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, in
addition to having energy quality advantages (cost, storability,
transportability, etc.) over many renewable technologies, also
have a temporal advantage after accounting for human
behavioral preference for current consumption/return."
2019,Context,Q40,"Biological organisms, including human societies both with

2018,Context,Q40,"Time spent on on-line interaction with members of one_s
own, preselected community leaves less time available for
actual encounters with a wide variety of people. If physicists,
for example, were to concentrate on exchanging email and
electronic preprints with other physicists around the world
working in the same specialized subject area, they would
likely devote less time, and be less receptive to new ways of
looking at the world. Facilitating the voluntary construction
of highly homogeneous social networks of scientific
communication therefore allows individuals to filter the
potentially overwhelming flow of information. But the
result may be the tendency to overfilter it, thus eliminating
the diversity of the knowledge circulating and diminishing
the frequency of radically new ideas. In this regard, even a
journey through the stacks of a real library can be more
fruitful than a trip through today_s distributed virtual
archives, because it seems difficult to use the available
search engines to emulate efficiently the mixture of
predictable and surprising discoveries that typically result
from a physical shelf-search of an extensive library collection."
2017,Context,Q40,"The impacts of tourism on the environment are evident
to scientists, but not all residents attribute environmental
damage to tourism. Residents commonly have positive
views on the economic and some sociocultural influences
of tourism on quality of life, but their reactions to
environmental impacts are mixed. Some residents feel
tourism provides more parks and recreation areas,
improves the quality of the roads and public facilities, and
does not contribute to ecological decline. Many do not
blame tourism for traffic problems, overcrowded outdoor
recreation, or the disturbance of peace and tranquility of
parks. Alternatively, some residents express concern that
tourists overcrowd the local fishing, hunting, and other
recreation areas or may cause traffic and pedestrian
congestion. Some studies suggest that variations in
residents feelings about tourism_s relationship to
environmental damage are related to the type of tourism,
the extent to which residents feel the natural environment
needs to be protected, and the distance residents live from
the tourist attractions."
2016,Context,Q40,"Performance must be judged in terms of what is under
the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than
those influences on performance that are beyond their
control. There can be broad, influential factors, sometimes
of an economic nature, that hold down the performance
of everyone being judged. One example is in sales. If there
is a general downturn in the economy and products or
services are not being purchased with the same frequency
as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example,
by an average of 15%. This 15% (actually 15%) figure
would then represent average performance. Perhaps the
best salesperson in the year had only a 3% drop in sales
over the previous year. Thus, good performance in this
situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or
norm group."
2015,Context,Q40,"Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly
established that certain works have certain effects. Plato is
sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us
cowardly; the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress
such representations. Tolstoy is confident that the artist
who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those
feelings on to us; we can no more escape than we could
escape an infectious disease. In fact, however, the effects
of art are neither so certain nor so direct. People vary a
great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and
in the form which that response takes. Some people may
indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of
working out those fantasies in real life. Others may be
disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence.
Still others may be left unmoved, neither attracted nor
disgusted."
2022,Infer-Logic,Q39,"As long as the irrealism of the silent black and white film
predominated, one could not take filmic fantasies for
representations of reality. Cinema is valuable not for its ability to make visible the
hidden outlines of our reality, but for its ability to reveal what
reality itself veils the dimension of fantasy. This is
why, to a person, the first great theorists of film decried the
introduction of sound and other technical innovations (such as
color) that pushed film in the direction of realism. Since
cinema was an entirely fantasmatic art, these innovations were
completely unnecessary. And what is worse, they could
do nothing but turn filmmakers and audiences away from the
fantasmatic dimension of cinema, potentially transforming
film into a mere delivery device for representations of
reality. But sound and color threatened to create just
such an illusion, thereby destroying the very essence of film
art. As Rudolf Arnheim puts it, The creative power of
the artist can only come into play where reality and the
medium of representation do not coincide."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q39,"Designers draw on their experience of design when approaching
a new project. This includes the use of previous designs that they
know work  both designs that they have created themselves and
those that others have created. Others creations often spark
inspiration that also leads to new ideas and innovation. This
is well known and understood. However, the expression
of an idea is protected by copyright, and people who infringe on
that copyright can be taken to court and prosecuted. Note that copyright covers the expression of an idea and
not the idea itself. This
means, for example, that while there are numerous smartphones
all with similar functionality, this does not represent an
infringement of copyright as the idea has been expressed in
different ways and it is the expression that has been
copyrighted. Copyright is free and is automatically
invested in the author, for instance, the writer of a book or a
programmer who develops a program, unless they sign the
copyright over to someone else."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q39,"The fragmentation of television audiences during recent
decades, which has happened throughout the globe as new
channels have been launched everywhere, has caused advertisers
much concern. Advertisers look back nostalgically to the
years when a single spot transmission would be seen by the
majority of the population at one fell swoop. This made
the television advertising of mass consumer products relatively
straightforward not to say easy whereas today it is necessary
for advertisers to build up coverage of their target markets over
time, by advertising on a host of channels with separate
audiences. Still, it is arguable that advertisers worry rather too much
about this problem, as advertising in other media has
always been fragmented. Moreover, advertisers gain considerable
benefits from the price competition between the numerous
broadcasting stations. And television remains much the
fastest way to build up public awareness of a new brand or a new
campaign. Seldom does a new brand or new campaign
that solely uses other media, without using television, reach high
levels of public awareness very quickly. ["
2019,Infer-Logic,Q39,"A major challenge for map-makers is the depiction of hills and
valleys, slopes and flatlands collectively called the topography.
This can be done in various ways. One is to create an image of
sunlight and shadow so that wrinkles of the topography are
alternately lit and shaded, creating a visual representation of the
shape of the land. Another, technically more accurate
way is to draw contour lines. A contour line connects all
points that lie at the same elevation. A round hill rising above a plain, therefore, would appear
on the map as a set of concentric circles, the largest at the
base and the smallest near the top. When the contour
lines are positioned closely together, the hill_s slope is steep; if
they lie farther apart, the slope is gentler. Contour lines
can represent scarps, hollows, and valleys of the local
topography. At a glance, they reveal whether the relief in
the mapped area is great or small: a busy contour map means
lots of high relief. ["
2018,Infer-Logic,Q39,"An incident in Japan in the 1950s alerted the world to the
potential problems of organic mercury in fish. Factories were
discharging mercury into the waters of Minamata Bay, which
also harbored a commercial fishing industry. Mercury was being
bioaccumulated in the fish tissue and severe mercury poisoning
occurred in many people who consumed the fish. The
disabling neurological symptoms were subsequently called
Minamata disease. Control over direct discharge of
mercury from industrial operations is clearly needed for
prevention. However, it is now recognized that traces of
mercury can appear in lakes far removed from any such
industrial discharge. It is postulated that such contamination may result from
airborne transport from remote power plants or municipal
incinerators. Strictly controlled emission standards
for such sources are needed to minimize this problem.
Fish advisories have been issued for many lakes in the United
States; these recommend limits on the number of times per
month particular species of fish should be consumed."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q39,"I expect that global society will increase annual investments
from 24% today to 36% of the GDP in 2052. Much of this
investment will be in energy-efficient goods that are more
expensive than old-fashioned stuff designed for an era of
cheap energy. Another share will be invested in the shift
from coal to more expensive fuels, like conventional gas. 
Some will go into the construction of new renewable energy
supply, even during the years before it becomes competitive.
 And a lot will go into repair of climate damage or
adaptation to future climate damage  for example, investing
in new protective walls along the coast to keep the rising
ocean back. These huge increases in investment would
not come about if investment was left to the market. Rather, they will happen only through state intervention,
based on parliamentary decision. It
will be either direct, when the government invests the tax
dollars in whatever capacity it considers to be most necessary,
or indirect, when the government passes legislation that makes
the desired activity more profitable."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q39,"Food intake is essential for the survival of every living
organism. The failure to detect spoiled or toxic food can
have deadly consequences. Therefore, it is not surprising that
humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality. A
first judgment about the value of a food source is made on
its appearance and smell. Food that looks and smells
attractive is taken into the mouth. Here, based on a complex
sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste
but also includes smell, touch, and hearing, the final decision
whether to swallow or reject food is made. Frequently,
this complex interaction between different senses is
inappropriately referred to as taste although it should be
better called flavor perception, because it uses multiple
senses."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q39,"Some years ago, a psychologist named Richard Lippa called
a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like
extroverts while pretending to teach a math class. Then
he and his team, with video cameras in hand, measured the
length of their strides, the amount of eye contact they made
with their students, the percentage of time they spent
talking, and the volume of their speech. They also rated how generally extroverted those fake
extroverts appeared, based on their recorded voices and
body language. Then Lippa
did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the
results. He found that although the latter group came
across as more extroverted, some of the fake extroverts were
surprisingly convincing. It seems that most of us
know how to fake it to some extent. Whether or not
we are aware that the length of our strides and the amount of
time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and
extroverts, we know it unconsciously. ["
2022,Infer-Logic,Q38,"Retraining current employees for new positions within the
company will also greatly reduce their fear of being laid
off. Introduction of robots into factories, while employment of human
workers is being reduced, creates worry and fear. It is
the responsibility of management to prevent or, at least, to ease
these fears. For example, robots could be introduced only
in new plants rather than replacing humans in existing assembly
lines. Workers should be included in the planning for
new factories or the introduction of robots into existing plants,
so they can participate in the process. It may be that robots
are needed to reduce manufacturing costs so that the company
remains competitive, but planning for such cost reductions
should be done jointly by labor and management. Since
robots are particularly good at highly repetitive simple motions,
the replaced human workers should be moved to positions
where judgment and decisions beyond the abilities of robots
are required."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q38,"Imagine I tell you that Maddy is bad. Perhaps you infer from
my intonation, or the context in which we are talking, that I
mean morally bad. Additionally, you will probably infer that I
am disapproving of Maddy, or saying that I think you should
disapprove of her, or similar, given typical linguistic conventions
and assuming I am sincere. However, you might not
get a more detailed sense of the particular sorts of way in
which Maddy is bad, her typical character traits, and the like,
since people can be bad in many ways. In contrast, if I
say that Maddy is wicked, then you get more of a sense of her
typical actions and attitudes to others. The word wicked
is more specific than bad. I have still not exactly pinpointed Maddy_s character since
wickedness takes many forms. But there is more detail
nevertheless, perhaps a stronger connotation of the sort of
person Maddy is. In addition, and again assuming
typical linguistic conventions, you should also get a sense that
I am disapproving of Maddy, or saying that you should
disapprove of her, or similar, assuming that we are still
discussing her moral character."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q38,"Resident-bird habitat selection is seemingly a straightforward
process in which a young dispersing individual moves until it
finds a place where it can compete successfully to satisfy its
needs. Initially, these needs include only food and
shelter. However, eventually, the young must locate,
identify, and settle in a habitat that satisfies not only survivorship
but reproductive needs as well. In some cases, the
habitat that provides the best opportunity for survival may not be
the same habitat as the one that provides for highest reproductive
capacity because of requirements specific to the reproductive
period. Thus, individuals of many resident species, confronted with
the fitness benefits of control over a productive breeding
site, may be forced to balance costs in the form of lower
nonbreeding survivorship by remaining in the specific
habitat where highest breeding success occurs. Migrants, however, are free to choose the
optimal habitat for survival during the nonbreeding season and
for reproduction during the breeding season. Thus,
habitat selection during these different periods can be quite
different for migrants as opposed to residents, even among
closely related species."
2019,Infer-Logic,Q38,"The printing press boosted the power of ideas to copy
themselves. Prior to low-cost printing, ideas could and did
spread by word of mouth. While this was tremendously
powerful, it limited the complexity of the ideas that could be
propagated to those that a single person could remember. 
It also added a certain amount of guaranteed error. The
spread of ideas by word of mouth was equivalent to a game of
telephone on a global scale. The advent of literacy and the creation of handwritten
scrolls and, eventually, handwritten books strengthened the
ability of large and complex ideas to spread with high
fidelity. But the incredible amount
of time required to copy a scroll or book by hand limited the
speed with which information could spread this way. A
well-trained monk could transcribe around four pages of text
per day. A printing press could copy information
thousands of times faster, allowing knowledge to spread far
more quickly, with full fidelity, than ever before."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q38,"Both humans and rats have evolved taste preferences for
sweet foods, which provide rich sources of calories. A study
of food preferences among the Hadza hunter-gatherers of
Tanzania found that honey was the most highly preferred food
item, an item that has the highest caloric value.) Human
newborn infants also show a strong preference for sweet
liquids. Both humans and rats dislike bitter and sour
foods, which tend to contain toxins. They also
adaptively adjust their eating behavior in response to deficits
in water, calories, and salt. Experiments show that rats display an immediate liking
for salt the first time they experience a salt deficiency. They likewise increase
their intake of sweets and water when their energy and fluids
become depleted. These appear to be specific evolved
mechanisms, designed to deal with the adaptive problem of
food selection, and coordinate consumption patterns with
physical needs."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q38,"What is the best order for a report, paper or other technical
document? Of course, it must be logical; but that means
simply that the paper must have connection and sequence,
and a variety of orders is possible under this heading. Too
many writers interpret the term logical to mean chronological,
and it has become habitual to begin reports and papers with
careful reviews of previous work. Usually, this is
tactically weak. Most readers of reports and papers are reading the
documents because they are interested in, and know
something about, the subject. Therefore, to rehearse to them the
findings of previous work is simply to bore them with
unnecessary reminders. The interesting thing for them
is the new information the new findings and conclusions. So it is usually best to start with those pieces of
information. To give a long chronological account of
work or procedures is normally appropriate only when the
essential point of the paper is the chronological sequence."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q38,"Money beyond the bare minimum necessary for food and
shelter is nothing more than a means to an end. Yet so
often we confuse means with ends, and sacrifice happiness
(end) for money (means). It is easy to do this when material
wealth is elevated to the position of the ultimate end, as it so
often is in our society. This is not to say that the
accumulation and production of material wealth is in itself
wrong. Material prosperity can help individuals, as well
as society, attain higher levels of happiness. Financial security can liberate us from work we do not find meaningful
and from having to worry about the next paycheck.
Moreover, the desire to make money can challenge and inspire
us. Even so, it is not the money per se that is valuable, but the
fact that it can potentially yield more positive experiences. Material wealth in and of itself does not necessarily
generate meaning or lead to emotional wealth."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q38,"Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued
researchers, and it has always been assumed that the insects
must rely on an internal clock. Recently, however, one group
of scientists working with the 17-year cicada in California
have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that
they can count. For their experiments they took
15-year-old nymphs and moved them to an experimental
enclosure. These nymphs should have taken a further
two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one
year. The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the
period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots
the insects fed were exposed. By doing this, the trees were tricked into
flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once.
 Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid
concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on. So it
seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the
peaks."
2022,Infer-Logic,Q37,"In spite of the likeness between the fictional and real
world, the fictional world deviates from the real one in one
important respect. The author has selected the content according to his own
worldview and his own conception of relevance, in an
attempt to be neutral and objective or convey a subjective
view on the world. Whatever the motives, the author_s
subjective conception of the world stands between the
reader and the original, untouched world on which the
story is based.
 Because of the inner qualities with which the individual is
endowed through heritage and environment, the mind
functions as a filter; every outside impression that passes
through it is filtered and interpreted. However, the world
the reader encounters in literature is already processed
and filtered by another consciousness.
 The existing world faced by the individual is in principle
an infinite chaos of events and details before it is organized
by a human mind. This chaos only gets processed and
modified when perceived by a human mind."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q37,"Experts have identified a large number of measures that
promote energy efficiency. Unfortunately many of them are
not cost effective. This is a fundamental requirement for
energy efficiency investment from an economic perspective. And this has direct repercussions at the individual level:
households can reduce the cost of electricity and gas bills,
and improve their health and comfort, while companies
can increase their competitiveness and their productivity.
Finally, the market for energy efficiency could contribute
to the economy through job and firms creation.
 There are significant externalities to take into account and
there are also macroeconomic effects. For instance, at the
aggregate level, improving the level of national energy
efficiency has positive effects on macroeconomic issues
such as energy dependence, climate change, health, national
competitiveness and reducing fuel poverty.
 However, the calculation of such cost effectiveness is not
easy: it is not simply a case of looking at private costs and
comparing them to the reductions achieved."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q37,"Traditionally, Kuhn claims, the primary goal of historians
of science was to clarify and deepen an understanding of
contemporary scientific methods or concepts by displaying
their evolution. This entailed relating the progressive accumulation of
breakthroughs and discoveries. Only that which survived in
some form in the present was considered relevant. In the
mid-1950s, however, a number of faults in this view of history
became apparent. Closer analysis of scientific discoveries,
for instance, led historians to ask whether the dates of
discoveries and their discoverers can be identified precisely. Some discoveries seem to entail numerous phases and
discoverers, none of which can be identified as definitive.
Furthermore, the evaluation of past discoveries and
discoverers according to present-day standards does not
allow us to see how significant they may have been in
their own day. Nor does the traditional view recognise the role that
non-intellectual factors, especially institutional and
socio-economic ones, play in scientific developments. Most
importantly, however, the traditional historian of science
seems blind to the fact that the concepts, questions and
standards that they use to frame the past are themselves
subject to historical change."
2019,Infer-Logic,Q37,"Clearly, schematic knowledge helps you guiding your
understanding and enabling you to reconstruct things you
cannot remember. But schematic knowledge can also hurt you, promoting
errors in perception and memory. Moreover, the types of
errors produced by schemata are quite predictable: Bear in
mind that schemata summarize the broad pattern of your
experience, and so they tell you, in essence, what is typical
or ordinary in a given situation. Any reliance on schematic knowledge, therefore, will be
shaped by this information about what is normal. Thus,
if there are things you do not notice while viewing a
situation or event, your schemata will lead you to fill in
these gaps with knowledge about what is normally in
place in that setting. Likewise, if there are things you ca not recall, your
schemata will fill in the gaps with knowledge about
what is typical in that situation. As a result, a reliance on
schemata will inevitably make the world seem more normal than it really is and will make the past seem
more regular than it actually was."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q37,"To modern man disease is a biological phenomenon that
concerns him only as an individual and has no moral
implications. When he contracts influenza, he never
attributes this event to his behavior toward the tax
collector or his mother-in-law. Among primitives, because of their supernaturalistic
theories, the prevailing moral point of view gives a
deeper meaning to disease. The gods who send disease
are usually angered by the moral offences of the
individual. Sometimes they may not strike the guilty person himself,
but rather one of his relatives or tribesmen, to whom
responsibility is extended. Disease, action that might
produce disease, and recovery from disease are,
therefore, of vital concern to the whole primitive
community. Disease, as a sanction against social misbehavior,
becomes one of the most important pillars of order in
such societies. It takes over, in many cases, the role
played by policemen, judges, and priests in modern
society."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q37,"Evolution works to maximize the number of descendants
that an animal leaves behind. Where the risk of death from
fishing increases as an animal grows, evolution favors
those that grow slowly, mature younger and smaller, and
reproduce earlier. This is exactly what we now see in the wild. Cod in
Canada_s Gulf of St. Lawrence begin to reproduce at
around four today; forty years ago they had to wait until
six or seven to reach maturity. Sole in the North Sea
mature at half the body weight they did in 1950. Surely these adaptations are good news for species
hard-pressed by excessive fishing? Not exactly. Young
fish produce many fewer eggs than large-bodied animals,
and many industrial fisheries are now so intensive that
few animals survive more than a couple of years beyond
the age of maturity. Together this means there are fewer eggs and larvae to
secure future generations. In some cases the amount of
young produced today is a hundred or even a thousand
times less than in the past, putting the survival of species,
and the fisheries dependent on them, at grave risk."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q37,"Remember when you were little and you imagined that
adults had infinite power? Surely someone who could drive
the car, open the juice container, and reach the sink could
make it stop raining. I think that is the same expectation
that we have with respect to our dogs and their ability to
smell. Because they are so good at using their noses,
we assume that they can smell anything, anytime. But
dogs use other senses, too, and the brains of both humans
and dogs tend to intensify one sense at a time. Many
owners have been snapped at by their dogs when they
returned home with a new hairdo or a new coat. Surprised by the vision of an unfamiliar silhouette pushing
into the house, these dogs were using their eyes instead of
their noses. Their
noses may be remarkable, but they are not always switched on."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q37,"Food plays a large part in how much you enjoy the
outdoors. The possibilities are endless, so you can
constantly vary your diet. Wilderness dining has two extremes: gourmet eaters and
survival eaters. The first like to make camp at lunchtime
so they have several hours to set up field ovens; they bake
cakes and bread and cook multi-course dinners. They walk only a few miles each day and may use the
same campsite for several nights. Survival eaters eat
some dry cereal for breakfast, and are up and walking
within minutes of waking. They walk dozens of miles every day; lunch is a series of
cold snacks eaten on the move. Dinner consists of a
freeze-dried meal, cooked by pouring hot water into the
package."
2022,Infer-Logic,Q36,"According to the market response model, it is increasing
prices that drive providers to search for new sources,
innovators to substitute, consumers to conserve, and
alternatives to emerge. Many examples of such green taxes exist. Facing landfill
costs, labor expenses, and related costs in the provision of
garbage disposal, for example, some cities have required
households to dispose of all waste in special trash bags,
purchased by consumers themselves, and often costing a
dollar or more each.
 Taxing certain goods or services, and so increasing prices,
should result in either decreased use of these resources or
creative innovation of new sources or options. The money
raised through the tax can be used directly by the government
either to supply services or to search for alternatives.
 The results have been greatly increased recycling and more
careful attention by consumers to packaging and waste.
By internalizing the costs of trash to consumers, there has
been an observed decrease in the flow of garbage from
households."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q36,"The objective of battle, to throw the enemy and to
make him defenseless, may temporarily blind commanders
and even strategists to the larger purpose of war. War is
never an isolated act, nor is it ever only one decision. To be political, a political entity or a representative of a
political entity, whatever its constitutional form, has to
have an intention, a will. That intention has to be clearly
expressed.
 In the real world, war_s larger purpose is always a political
purpose. It transcends the use of force. This insight was
famously captured by Clausewitz_s most famous phrase, War is a mere continuation of politics by other means. And one side_s will has to be transmitted to the enemy at
some point during the confrontation (it does not have to be
publicly communicated). A violent act and its larger political
intention must also be attributed to one side at some point
during the confrontation. History does not know of acts of
war without eventual attribution."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q36,"Movies may be said to support the dominant culture and
to serve as a means for its reproduction over time. But one may ask why audiences would find such movies
enjoyable if all they do is give cultural directives and
prescriptions for proper living. Most of us would likely
grow tired of such didactic movies and would probably
come to see them as propaganda, similar to the cultural
artwork that was common in the Soviet Union and other
autocratic societies. The simple answer to this question is that movies do more
than present two-hour civics lessons or editorials on
responsible behavior. They also tell stories that, in the
end, we find satisfying. The bad guys are usually punished; the romantic couple
almost always find each other despite the obstacles and
difficulties they encounter on the path to true love; and
the way we wish the world to be is how, in the movies, it
more often than not winds up being. No doubt it is this
utopian aspect of movies that accounts for why we enjoy
them so much."
2019,Infer-Logic,Q36,"Researchers in psychology follow the scientific method
to perform studies that help explain and may predict human
behavior. This is a much more challenging task than studying
snails or sound waves. It often requires compromises, such as testing behavior
within laboratories rather than natural settings, and asking
those readily available (such as introduction to psychology
students) to participate rather than collecting data from a
true cross-section of the population. It often requires great
cleverness to conceive of measures that tap into what
people are thinking without altering their thinking, called
reactivity. Simply knowing they are being observed may cause
people to behave differently (such as more politely!).
People may give answers that they feel are more socially
desirable than their true feelings. But for all of these difficulties for psychology, the payoff
of the scientific method is that the findings are replicable;
that is, if you run the same study again following the
same procedures, you will be very likely to get the same
results."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q36,"Most consumer magazines depend on subscriptions and
advertising. Subscriptions account for almost 90 percent
of total magazine circulation. Single-copy, or newsstand,
sales account for the rest. However, single-copy sales are important: they bring in
more revenue per magazine, because subscription prices
are typically at least 50 percent less than the price of
buying single issues. Further, potential readers explore a new magazine by
buying a single issue; all those insert cards with
subscription offers are included in magazines to
encourage you to subscribe. Some magazines are
distributed only by subscription. Professional or trade
magazines are specialized magazines and are often
published by professional associations. They usually
feature highly targeted advertising. For example, the Columbia Journalism Review is
marketed toward professional journalists and its few
advertisements are news organizations, book publishers,
and others. A few magazines, like Consumer Reports,
work toward objectivity and therefore contain no
advertising."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q36,"Interestingly, being observed has two quite distinct
effects on performance. In some cases, performance is
decreased, even to the point of non-existence. The
extreme of this is stage fright, the sudden fear of public
performance. There are many instances of well-known actors who, in
mid-career, develop stage fright and simply cannot
perform. The other extreme is that being observed
enhances performance, people doing whatever it might
be better when they know that others are watching. The general rule seems to be that if one is doing
something new or for the first time, then being observed
while doing it decreases performance. On the other hand,
being observed while doing some task or engaging in
some activity that is well known or well practiced tends
to enhance performance. So, if you are learning to play a new sport, it is better to
begin it alone, but when you become skilled at it, then
you will probably perform better with an audience."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q36,"Sometimes, after punishment has been administered a
few times, it need not be continued, because the mere threat
of punishment is enough to induce the desired behavior. Psychologists call this avoidance training because the
person is learning to avoid the possibility of a punishing
consequence. Avoidance training is responsible for many
everyday behaviors. It has taught you to carry an
umbrella when it looks like rain to avoid the punishment
of getting wet, and to keep your hand away from a hot
iron to avoid the punishment of a burn. Avoidance training, however, does not always work in our
favor. For instance, a child who has been repeatedly
criticized for poor performance on math may learn to
dodge difficult math problems in order to avoid further
punishment. Unfortunately, because of this avoidance, the child fails
to develop his math skills and therefore improve the
capabilities he has, and so a vicious cycle has set in.
The avoidance must be unlearned through some positive
experiences with math in order for this cycle to be broken."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q36,"The impact of color has been studied for decades. For
example, in a factory, the temperature was maintained at
72 and the walls were painted a cool blue-green. The
employees complained of the cold. The temperature was maintained at the same level, but the
walls were painted a warm coral. The employees stopped
complaining about the temperature and reported they
were quite comfortable. The psychological effects of warm and cool hues seem to
be used effectively by the coaches of the Notre Dame
football team. The locker rooms used for half-time breaks
were reportedly painted to take advantage of the
emotional impact of certain hues. The home-team room was painted a bright red, which
kept team members excited or even angered. The
visiting-team room was painted a blue-green, which had a
calming effect on the team members. The success of this
application of color can be noted in the records set by
Notre Dame football teams."
2022,Infer-Logic,Q35,"Since their introduction, information systems have
substantially changed the way business is conducted. This is
particularly true for business in the shape and form of
cooperation between firms that involves an integration of value
chains across multiple units. The resulting networks do not
only cover the business units of a single firm but typically also
include multiple units from different firms. As a consequence,
firms do not only need to consider their internal organization
in order to ensure sustainable business performance; they also
need to take into account the entire ecosystem of units
surrounding them. In order to allow these
different units to cooperate successfully, the existence of a
common platform is crucial."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q35,"Workers are united by laughing at shared events, even ones
that may initially spark anger or conflict. Humor reframes
potentially divisive events into merely laughable ones which
are put in perspective as subservient to unifying values held
by organization members. Repeatedly recounting humorous
incidents reinforces unity based on key organizational values. One team told repeated stories about a dumpster fire,
something that does not seem funny on its face, but the
reactions of workers motivated to preserve safety sparked
laughter as the stories were shared multiple times by multiple
parties in the workplace. Shared events that cause laughter
can indicate a sense of belonging since you had to be there to see the humor in them, and non-members were not and do
not. Instances of humor serve to enact bonds
among organization members. Understanding the humor may
even be required as an informal badge of membership in the
organization."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q35,"Although commonsense knowledge may have merit, it also
has weaknesses, not the least of which is that it often contradicts
itself. For example, we hear that people who are similar will like
one another (Birds of a feather flock together) but also that
persons who are dissimilar will like each other (Opposites
attract). We are told that groups are wiser and smarter than
individuals (Two heads are better than one) but also that group
work inevitably produces poor results (Too many cooks spoil
the broth).  Each of these contradictory statements may hold
true under particular conditions, but without a clear statement of
when they apply and when they do not, aphorisms provide little
insight into relations among people. They provide
even less guidance in situations where we must make decisions. For example, when facing a choice that entails risk, which
guideline should we use Nothing ventured, nothing gained
or Better safe than sorry?"
2019,Infer-Logic,Q35,"When photography came along in the nineteenth century,
painting was put in crisis. The photograph, it seemed, did
the work of imitating nature better than the painter ever could. Some painters made practical use of the invention. There
were Impressionist painters who used a photograph in place of
the model or landscape they were painting. But by and
large, the photograph was a challenge to painting and was one
cause of painting_s moving away from direct representation
and reproduction to the abstract painting of the twentieth
century. Since photographs did such a good job of
representing things as they existed in the world, painters were
freed to look inward and represent things as they were in their
imagination, rendering emotion in the color, volume, line, and
spatial configurations native to the painter_s art."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q35,"In the context of SNS, media literacy has been argued to
be especially important in order to make the users aware
of their rights when using SNS tools, and also help them
acquire or reinforce human rights values and develop the
behaviour necessary to respect other people_s rights and
freedoms. With regard to peer-to-peer risks such as
bullying, this last element is of particular importance. This
relates to a basic principle that children are taught in the
offline world as well: do not do to others what you would
not want others to do to you.  This should also be a golden rule with regard
to SNS, but for children and young people it is much more
difficult to estimate the consequences and potential serious
impact of their actions in this environment. Hence, raising
awareness of children from a very early age about the
particular characteristics of SNS and the potential long-term
impact of a seemingly trivial act is crucial."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q35,"Most often, you will find or meet people who introduce
themselves in terms of their work or by what they spend time
on. These people introduce themselves as a salesman or an
executive. There is nothing criminal in doing this, but
psychologically, we become what we believe. People who follow this practice
tend to lose their individuality and begin to live with the notion
that they are recognized by the job they do. However, jobs
may not be permanent, and you may lose your job for
countless reasons, some of which you may not even be
responsible for. In such a case, these people suffer from an
inevitable social and mental trauma, leading to emotional
stress and a feeling that all of a sudden they have been
disassociated from what once was their identity."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q35,"Some people make few intentional changes in life. Sure,
over time they may get fatter, gather lines, and go gray. But they wear their hair the same way, buy the same
brand of shoes, eat the same breakfast, and stick to
routines for no reason other than the ease of a
comfortable, predictable life. Yet as both research and
real life show, many others do make important changes. They train for marathons, quit smoking, switch fields,
write plays, take up the guitar, or learn to tango even if
they never danced before in their lives. What is the
difference between these two groups of people? It is their perspective. People who change do not question
whether change is possible or look for reasons they
cannot change. They simply decide on a change they
want and do what is necessary to accomplish it.
Changing, which always stems from a firm decision,
becomes job number one."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q35,"A currently popular attitude is to blame technology or
technologists for having brought on the environmental
problems we face today, and thus to try to slow technological
advance by blocking economic growth. We believe this view
to be thoroughly misguided. If technology produced
automobiles that pollute the air, it is because pollution was not
recognized as a problem which engineers had to consider in
their designs. Obviously,
technology that produces pollution is generally cheaper, but
now that it has been decided that cleaner cars are wanted, less
polluting cars will be produced; cars which scarcely pollute at
all could even be made. This last option, however, would
require several years and much investment. Although
technology is responsive to the will of the people, it can
seldom respond instantaneously and is never free."
2022,Infer-Logic,Q34,"Precision and determinacy are a necessary requirement for
all meaningful scientific debate, and progress in the sciences
is, to a large extent, the ongoing process of achieving ever
greater precision. But historical representation puts a premium
on a proliferation of representations, hence not on the
refinement of one representation but on the production of
an ever more varied set of representations. Historical insight
is not a matter of a continuous narrowing down of previous
options, not of an approximation of the truth, but, on the
contrary, is an explosion of possible points of view. It
therefore aims at the unmasking of previous illusions of
determinacy and precision by the production of new and
alternative representations, rather than at achieving truth by
a careful analysis of what was right and wrong in those
previous representations. And from this perspective, the
development of historical insight may indeed be regarded by the
outsider as a process of creating ever more confusion, a continuous
questioning of certainty and precision seemingly achieved already,
rather than, as in the sciences, an ever greater approximation
to the truth. ["
2021,Infer-Logic,Q34,"Successful integration of an educational technology is
marked by that technology being regarded by users as an
unobtrusive facilitator of learning, instruction, or performance.
When the focus shifts from the technology being used to the
educational purpose that technology serves, then that
technology is becoming a comfortable and trusted element,
and can be regarded as being successfully integrated. Few
people give a second thought to the use of a ball-point pen
although the mechanisms involved vary some use a twist
mechanism and some use a push button on top, and there are
other variations as well. Personal computers have reached a
similar level of familiarity for a great many users, but certainly
not for all. New and emerging technologies often introduce
both fascination and frustration with users. As long as the user_s focus is on the technology itself rather than its use in
promoting learning, instruction, or performance, then one
ought not to conclude that the technology has been successfully
integrated at least for that user."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q34,"There have been many attempts to define what music is in
terms of the specific attributes of musical sounds. The famous
nineteenth-century critic Eduard Hanslick regarded the
measurable tone as the primary and essential condition of all
music. Musical sounds, he was saying, can be distinguished
from those of nature by the fact that they involve the use of
fixed pitches, whereas virtually all natural sounds consist of
constantly fluctuating frequencies. And a number of
twentieth-century writers have assumed, like Hanslick, that
fixed pitches are among the defining features of music. Now it
is true that in most of the world_s musical cultures, pitches are not only fixed, but organized into a series of discrete steps. However,
this is a generalization about music and not a definition of it,
for it is easy to put forward counter-examples. Japanese
shakuhachi music and the sanjo music of Korea, for instance,
fluctuate constantly around the notional pitches in terms of
which the music is organized."
2019,Infer-Logic,Q34,"The human species is unique in its ability to expand its
functionality by inventing new cultural tools. Writing, arithmetic,
science all are recent inventions. Our brains did not have
enough time to evolve for them, but I reason that they were made
possible because we can mobilize our old areas in novel ways.
When we learn to read, we recycle a specific region of our
visual system known as the visual word-form area, enabling us
to recognize strings of letters and connect them to language
areas. Likewise, when we learn Arabic numerals we build a
circuit to quickly convert those shapes into quantities a fast
connection from bilateral visual areas to the parietal quantity
area. Even an invention as elementary as finger-counting changes
our cognitive abilities dramatically. Amazonian people who have
not invented counting are unable to make exact calculations as
simple as, say, 6?2. This cultural recycling implies that the
functional architecture of the human brain results from a complex
mixture of biological and cultural constraints."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q34,"Over the past 60 years, as mechanical processes have
replicated behaviors and talents we thought were unique to
humans, we have had to change our minds about what sets
us apart. As we invent more species of AI, we will be
forced to surrender more of what is supposedly unique
about humans. Each step of surrender we are not the only
mind that can play chess, fly a plane, make music, or invent
a mathematical law  will be painful and sad. We will spend
the next three decades  indeed, perhaps the next century 
in a permanent identity crisis, continually asking ourselves
what humans are good for. If we are not unique toolmakers,
or artists, or moral ethicists, then what, if anything, makes
us special? In the grandest irony of all, the greatest benefit
of an everyday, utilitarian AI will not be increased
productivity or an economics of abundance or a new way of
doing science although all those will happen. The
greatest benefit of the arrival of artificial intelligence is that AIs will help define humanity."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q34,"Over a period of time the buildings which housed social,
legal, religious, and other rituals evolved into forms that we
subsequently have come to recognize and associate with those buildings function.
This is a two-way process; the building provides the physical
environment and setting for a particular social ritual such as
traveling by train or going to the theater, as well as the
symbolic setting. The meaning of buildings evolves and
becomes established by experience and we in turn read our
experience into buildings. Buildings arouse an empathetic
reaction in us through these projected experiences, and the
strength of these reactions is determined by our culture, our
beliefs, and our expectations. They tell stories, for their form
and spatial organization give us hints about how they should be
used. Their physical layout encourages some uses and inhibits
others; we do not go backstage in a theater unless especially
invited. Inside a law court the precise location of those
involved in the legal process is an integral part of the design
and an essential part of ensuring that the law is upheld."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q34,"Long before Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass, poets had
addressed themselves to fame. Horace, Petrarch, Shakespeare,
Milton, and Keats all hoped that poetic greatness would grant
them a kind of earthly immortality. Whitman held a similar
faith that for centuries the world would value his poems. But
to this ancient desire to live forever on the page, he added a
new sense of fame. Readers would not simply attend to the
poet_s work; they would be attracted to the greatness of his
personality. They would see in his poems a vibrant cultural
performance, an individual springing from the book with
tremendous charisma and appeal. Out of the political rallies
and electoral parades that marked Jacksonian America, Whitman
defined poetic fame in relation to the crowd. Other poets
might look for their inspiration from the goddess of poetry.
Whitman_s poet sought immortality in literature itself.
In the instability of American democracy, fame would be
dependent on celebrity, on the degree to which the people
rejoiced in the poet and his work."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q34,"New media can be defined by four characteristics
simultaneously: they are media at the turn of the 20th and 21st
centuries which are both integrated and interactive and use
digital code and hypertext as technical means. It follows that
their most common alternative names are multimedia,
interactive media and digital media. By using this definition,
it is easy to identify media as old or new. For example,
traditional television is integrated as it contains images, sound
and text, but it is not interactive or based on digital code. The
plain old telephone was interactive, but not integrated as it
only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with
digital code. In contrast, the new medium of interactive
television adds interactivity and digital code. Additionally,
the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully
digitalized and integrated as they add text, pictures or video
and they are connected to the Internet."
2022,Infer-Logic,Q33,"Elinor Ostrom found that there are several factors critical to
bringing about stable institutional solutions to the problem of
the commons. She pointed out, for instance, that the actors
affected by the rules for the use and care of resources must
have the right to participate in decisions to change the rules.
For that reason, the people who monitor and control the
behavior of users should also be users and/or have been given
a mandate by all users. This is a significant insight, as it shows
that prospects are poor for a centrally directed solution to the
problem of the commons coming from a state power in
comparison with a local solution for which users assume
personal responsibility. Ostrom also emphasizes the importance
of democratic decision processes and that all users must be
given access to local forums for solving problems and conflicts
among themselves. Political institutions at central, regional,
and local levels must allow users to devise their own regulations
and independently ensure observance."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q33,"Thanks to newly developed neuroimaging technology, we
now have access to the specific brain changes that occur during
learning. Even though all of our brains contain the same basic
structures, our neural networks are as unique as our fingerprints.
The latest developmental neuroscience research has shown
that the brain is much more malleable throughout life than
previously assumed; it develops in response to its own
processes, to its immediate and distant environments, and
to its past and current situations. The brain seeks to create
meaning through establishing or refining existing neural
networks. When we learn a new fact or skill, our neurons
communicate to form networks of connected information. Using
this knowledge or skill results in structural changes to allow
similar future impulses to travel more quickly and efficiently
than others. High-activity synaptic connections are stabilized
and strengthened, while connections with relatively low use are
weakened and eventually pruned. In this way, our brains are sculpted by our own history of experiences."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q33,"The future of our high-tech goods may lie not in the limitations
of our minds, but in our ability to secure the ingredients to produce them.
In previous eras, such as the Iron Age and the Bronze Age, the
discovery of new elements brought forth seemingly unending
numbers of new inventions. Now the combinations may truly be
unending. We are now witnessing a fundamental shift in our
resource demands. At no point in human history have we used
more elements, in more combinations, and in increasingly refined
amounts. Our ingenuity will soon outpace our material supplies.
This situation comes at a defining moment when the world is
struggling to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Fortunately, rare
metals are key ingredients in green technologies such as electric
cars, wind turbines, and solar panels. They help to convert free
natural resources like the sun and wind into the power that fuels
our lives. But without increasing today_s limited supplies, we
have no chance of developing the alternative green technologies
we need to slow climate change."
2019,Infer-Logic,Q33,"Heritage is concerned with the ways in which very selective
material artefacts, mythologies, memories and traditions
become resources for the present. The contents, interpretations
and representations of the resource are selected according to
the demands of the present; an imagined past provides
resources for a heritage that is to be passed onto an imagined
future. It follows too that the meanings and functions of
memory and tradition are defined in the present. Further,
heritage is more concerned with meanings than material
artefacts. It is the former that give value, either cultural or
financial, to the latter and explain why they have been selected
from the near infinity of the past. In turn, they may later be
discarded as the demands of present societies change, or even,
as is presently occurring in the former Eastern Europe, when
pasts have to be reinvented to reflect new presents. Thus
heritage is as much about forgetting as remembering the past."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q33,"In the less developed world, the percentage of the
population involved in agriculture is declining, but at the
same time, those remaining in agriculture are not benefiting
from technological advances. The typical scenario in the less
developed world is one in which a very few commercial
agriculturalists are technologically advanced while the vast
majority are incapable of competing. Indeed, this vast majority 
have lost control over their own production
 because of larger global causes. As an example, in Kenya, farmers are
actively encouraged to grow export crops such as tea and
coffee at the expense of basic food production. The result is
that a staple crop, such as maize, is not being produced in a
sufficient amount. The essential argument here is that the
capitalist mode of production is affecting peasant production
in the less developed world in such a way as to limit the
production of staple foods, thus causing a food problem."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q33,"Grief is unpleasant. Would one not then be better off
without it altogether? Why accept it even when the loss is
real? Perhaps we should say of it what Spinoza said of regret:
that whoever feels it is twice unhappy or twice helpless.
Laurence Thomas has suggested that the utility of negative
sentiments (emotions like grief, guilt, resentment, and anger,
which there is seemingly a reason to believe we might be
better off without) lies in their providing a kind of guarantee
of authenticity for such dispositional sentiments as love
and respect. No occurrent feelings of love and respect need
to be present throughout the period in which it is true that
one loves or respects. One might therefore sometimes
suspect, in the absence of the positive occurrent feelings, that one no longer loves. At such times,
negative emotions like grief offer a kind of testimonial to the
authenticity of love or respect. ["
2016,Infer-Logic,Q33,"Research and development for seed improvement has long
been a public domain and government activity for the
common good. However, private capital started to flow into
seed production and took it over as a sector of the economy,
creating an artificial split between the two aspects of the
seed_s nature: its role as means of production and its role as
product. This process gained pace after the invention of
hybrid breeding of maize in the late 1920s. Today most maize
seed cultivated are hybrids. The companies that sell them are
able to keep the distinct parent lines from farmers, and the
grain that they produce is not suited for seed saving and
replanting. The combination guarantees that farmers will
have to buy more seed from the company each season. In the
1990s the extension of patent laws as the only intellectual
property rights tool into the area of seed varieties started to
create a growing market for private seed companies."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q33,"According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the
size and complexity of human populations was the driving
force in the evolution of science. Early, small communities had
to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival;
their thoughts were focused on food and religion. As
communities became larger, some people had time to reflect
and debate. They found that they could understand and predict
events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing
these with observation and inference. But while a large
population may have been necessary, in itself it was not
sufficient for science to germinate. Some empires were big,
but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together
was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to
reason. The early nurturing and later flowering of science required a large and loosely structured, competitive community 
to support original thought and freewheeling incentive. The rise in
commerce and the decline of authoritarian religion allowed
science to follow reason in seventeenth-century Europe."
2022,Infer-Logic,Q32,"News, especially in its televised form, is constituted not
only by its choice of topics and stories but by its verbal and visual idioms or modes of address. Presentational
styles have been subject to a tension between an
informational-educational purpose and the need to engage us
entertainingly. While current affairs programmes are often serious in tone sticking to the rules of balance, more
popular programmes adopt a friendly, lighter, idiom in which
we are invited to consider the impact of particular news items
from the perspective of the average person in the street.
Indeed, contemporary news construction has come to rely on an
increased use of faster editing tempos and flashier presentational
styles including the use of logos, sound-bites, rapid visual cuts
and the star quality of news readers. Popular formats can be
said to enhance understanding by engaging an audience unwilling
to endure the longer verbal orientation of older news formats.
However, they arguably work to reduce understanding by
failing to provide the structural contexts for news events."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q32,"Choosing similar friends can have a rationale. Assessing
the survivability of an environment can be risky (if an
environment turns out to be deadly, for instance, it might be
too late by the time you found out), so humans have evolved
the desire to associate with similar individuals as a way to
perform this function efficiently. This is especially useful to a
species that lives in so many different sorts of environments.
However, the carrying capacity of a given environment places a limit on this strategy. If resources
are very limited, the individuals who live in a particular place
cannot all do the exact same thing (for example, if there are
few trees, people cannot all live in tree houses, or if mangoes
are in short supply, people cannot all live solely on a diet of
mangoes). A rational strategy would therefore sometimes be to
avoid similar members of one_s species."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q32,"The Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget frequently analyzed
children_s conception of time via their ability to compare or
estimate the time taken by pairs of events. In a typical
experiment, two toy cars were shown running synchronously
on parallel tracks, one running faster and stopping further down the track.
The children were then asked to judge whether the cars had
run for the same time and to justify their judgment.
Preschoolers and young school-age children confuse temporal
and spatial dimensions: Starting times are judged by starting
points, stopping times by stopping points and durations by
distance, though each of these errors does not necessitate the
others. Hence, a child may claim that the cars started and
stopped running together (correct) and that the car which
stopped further ahead, ran for more time (incorrect)."
2019,Infer-Logic,Q32,"Minorities tend not to have much power or status and may
even be dismissed as troublemakers, extremists or simply weirdos. How, then, do they ever have any influence over the
majority? The social psychologist Serge Moscovici claims that
the answer lies in their behavioural style, i.e. the way the minority gets its point across. The crucial factor
in the success of the suffragette movement was that its
supporters were consistent in their views, and this created a
considerable degree of social influence. Minorities that are
active and organised, who support and defend their position
consistently, can create social conflict, doubt and uncertainty
among members of the majority, and ultimately this may lead
to social change. Such change has often occurred because a
minority has converted others to its point of view. Without the
influence of minorities, we would have no innovation, no
social change. Many of what we now regard as major social
movements (e.g. Christianity, trade unionism or feminism)
were originally due to the influence of an outspoken minority."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q32,"How many of the lunches that you ate over the last week
can you recall? Do you remember what you ate today? I hope
so. Yesterday? I bet it takes a moment_s effort. And what
about the day before yesterday? What about a week ago? It is
not so much that your memory of last week_s lunch has
disappeared; if provided with the right cue, like where you
ate it, or whom you ate it with, you would likely recall what
had been on your plate. Rather, it is difficult to remember last
week_s lunch because your brain has filed it away with all
the other lunches you have ever eaten as just another lunch.
When we try to recall something from a category that
includes as many instances as lunch or wine, many
memories compete for our attention. The memory of last
Wednesday_s lunch is not necessarily gone; it is that you lack the right hook to pull it out of a sea of lunchtime memories. But
a wine that talks: That is unique. It is a memory without rivals."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q32,"Temporal resolution is particularly interesting in the
context of satellite remote sensing. The temporal density of
remotely sensed imagery is large, impressive, and growing.
Satellites are collecting a great deal of imagery as you read
this sentence. However, most applications in geography and
environmental studies do not require extremely fine-grained
temporal resolution. Meteorologists may require visible,
infrared, and radar information at sub-hourly temporal
resolution; urban planners might require imagery at monthly
or annual resolution; and transportation planners may not
need any time series information at all for some applications.
Again, the temporal resolution of imagery used should meet the requirements of your inquiry. Sometimes
researchers have to search archives of aerial photographs to
get information from that past that pre-date the collection of
satellite imagery."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q32,"Some distinctions between good and bad are hardwired into
our biology. Infants enter the world ready to respond to pain as
bad and to sweet (up to a point) as good. In many situations,
however, the boundary between good and bad is a reference
point that changes over time and depends on the immediate
circumstances. Imagine that you are out in the country on a cold
night, inadequately dressed for the pouring rain, your clothes
soaked. A stinging cold wind completes your misery. As you
wander around, you find a large rock that provides some shelter
from the fury of the elements. The biologist Michel Cabanac
would call the experience of that moment intensely pleasurable
because it functions, as pleasure normally does, to indicate the
direction of a biologically significant improvement of circumstances.
The pleasant relief will not last very long, of course, and you
will soon be shivering behind the rock again, driven by your
renewed suffering to seek better shelter."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q32,"My friend was disappointed that scientific progress has not
cured the world_s ills by abolishing wars and starvation; that
gross human inequality is still widespread; that happiness is
not universal. My friend made a common mistake a basic
misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge. Knowledge is
amoral not immoral but morality neutral. It can be used for
any purpose, but many people assume it will be used to further
their favorite hopes for society and this is the fundamental flaw.
Knowledge of the world is one thing; its uses create a separate
issue. To be disappointed that our progress in understanding
has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate
view, but to confuse this with the progress of knowledge is absurd.
To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the
African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point. There is
nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social
or moral application. "
2022,Infer-Logic,Q31,"Humour involves not just practical disengagement but
cognitive disengagement. As long as something is funny, we
are for the moment not concerned with whether it is real or
fictional, true or false. This is why we give considerable
leeway to people telling funny stories. If they are getting extra
laughs by exaggerating the silliness of a situation or even by
making up a few details, we are happy to grant them comic
licence, a kind of poetic licence. Indeed, someone listening to
a funny story who tries to correct the teller. No, he did not
spill the spaghetti on the keyboard and the monitor, just on the
keyboard will probably be told by the other listeners to
stop interrupting. The creator of humour is putting ideas into
people_s heads for the pleasure those ideas will bring, not to
provide accurate information."
2021,Infer-Logic,Q31,"In the classic model of the Sumerian economy, the temple
functioned as an administrative authority governing commodity
production, collection, and redistribution. The discovery of
administrative tablets from the temple complexes at Uruk
suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a
tool of centralized economic governance. Given the lack of
archaeological evidence from Uruk-period domestic sites, it is
not clear whether individuals also used the system for personal agreements. 
For that matter, it is not clear
how widespread literacy was at its beginnings. The use of
identifiable symbols and pictograms on the early tablets is
consistent with administrators needing a lexicon that was
mutually intelligible by literate and nonliterate parties. As
cuneiform script became more abstract, literacy must have
become increasingly important to ensure one understood what
he or she had agreed to."
2020,Infer-Logic,Q31,"The role of science can sometimes be overstated, with its
advocates slipping into scientism. Scientism is the view that
the scientific description of reality is the only truth there is.
With the advance of science, there has been a tendency to slip
into scientism, and assume that any factual claim can be
authenticated if and only if the term scientific can correctly
be ascribed to it. The consequence is that non-scientific
approaches to reality and that can include all the arts,
religion, and personal, emotional and value-laden ways of
encountering the world  may become labelled as merely
subjective, and therefore of little account in terms of
describing the way the world is. The philosophy of science
seeks to avoid crude scientism and get a balanced view on
what the scientific method can and cannot achieve."
2019,Infer-Logic,Q31,"Finkenauer and Rim? investigated the memory of the
unexpected death of Belgium_s King Baudouin in 1993 in a
large sample of Belgian citizens. The data revealed that the
news of the king_s death had been widely socially shared. By
talking about the event, people gradually constructed a social
narrative and a collective memory of the emotional event. At
the same time, they consolidated their own memory of the
personal circumstances in which the event took place, an
effect known as flashbulb memory. The more an event is
socially shared, the more it will be fixed in people_s minds.
Social sharing may in this way help to counteract some natural
tendency people may have. Naturally, people should be driven
to forget undesirable events. Thus, someone who just heard
a piece of bad news often tends initially to deny what happened.
The repetitive social sharing of the bad news contributes to
realism."
2018,Infer-Logic,Q31,"Apocalypse Now, a film produced and directed by Francis
Ford Coppola, gained widespread popularity, and for good
reason. The film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad_s novel
Heart of Darkness, which is set in the African Congo at the
end of the 19th century. Unlike the original novel, Apocalypse
Now is set in Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War.
The setting, time period, dialogue and other incidental details
are changed but the fundamental narrative and themes of
Apocalypse Now are the same as those of Heart of Darkness.
Both describe a physical journey, reflecting the central
character_s mental and spiritual journey, down a river to
confront the deranged Kurtz character, who represents the
worst aspects of civilisation. By giving Apocalypse Now a
setting that was contemporary at the time of its release,
audiences were able to experience and identify with its
themes more easily than they would have if the film had been a literal adaptation of the novel."
2017,Infer-Logic,Q31,"The creativity that children possess needs to be cultivated
throughout their development. Research suggests that
overstructuring the child_s environment may actually limit
creative and academic development. This is a central problem
with much of science instruction. The exercises or activities
are devised to eliminate different options and to focus on
predetermined results. The answers are structured to fit the
course assessments, and the wonder of science is lost along
with cognitive intrigue. We define cognitive intrigue as the
wonder that stimulates and intrinsically motivates an
individual to voluntarily engage in an activity. The loss of
cognitive intrigue may be initiated by the sole use of play
items with predetermined conclusions and reinforced by rote
instruction in school. This is exemplified by toys, games, and
lessons that are an end in and of themselves and
require little of the individual other than to master the planned
objective."
2016,Infer-Logic,Q31,"When two cultures come into contact, they do not
exchange every cultural item. If that were the case, there
would be no cultural differences in the world today. Instead,
only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from
one culture to another. Which cultural item is accepted
depends largely on the item_s use and compatibility with
already existing cultural traits. For example, it is not likely
that men_s hair dyes designed to get out the gray will spread
into parts of rural Africa where a person_s status is elevated
with advancing years. Even when an investigation is
consistent with a society_s needs, there is still no guarantee
that it will be accepted. For example, most people in the
United States using US customary units (e.g., inch, foot, yard,
mile, etc.) have resisted adopting the metric system even
though making such a change would enable US citizens to
interface with the rest of the world more efficiently."
2015,Infer-Logic,Q31,"The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has
been studied by psychologists since the 1920s, but the term multitasking did not exist until the 1960s. It was used to
describe computers, not people. Back then, ten megahertz was
so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computer_s
ability to quickly perform many tasks. In retrospect, they
probably made a poor choice, for the expression multitasking
is inherently deceptive. Multitasking is about multiple tasks
alternately sharing one resource (the CPU), but in time the
context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple
tasks being done simultaneously by one resource (a person). It
was a clever turn of phrase that is misleading, for even
computers can process only one piece of code at a time. When
they multitask, they switch back and forth, alternating their
attention until both tasks are done. The speed with which
computers tackle multiple tasks feeds the illusion that
everything happens at the same time, so comparing computers
to humans can be confusing. "
2022,Context,Q24,"Mending and restoring objects often require even more
creativity than original production. The preindustrial blacksmith
made things to order for people in his immediate community;
customizing the product, modifying or transforming it according
to the user, was routine. Customers would bring things back if
something went wrong; repair was thus an extension of
fabrication. With industrialization and eventually with mass
production, making things became the province of machine
tenders with limited knowledge. But repair continued to require
a larger grasp of design and materials, an understanding of the
whole and a comprehension of the designer_s intentions. 
Manufacturers all work by machinery or by vast subdivision
of labour and not, so to speak, by hand, an 1896 Manual of
Mending and Repairing explained. But all repairing must be
done by hand. We can make every detail of a watch or of a
gun by machinery, but the machine cannot mend it when
broken, much less a clock or a pistol!"
2021,Context,Q24,"People do not usually think of touch as a temporal
phenomenon, but it is every bit as time-based as it is spatial.
You can carry out an experiment to see for yourself. Ask a
friend to cup his hand, palm face up, and close his eyes. Place
a small ordinary object in his palm a ring, an eraser,
anything will do and ask him to identify it without moving
any part of his hand. He will  not have a clue other than weight
and maybe overall size. Then tell him to keep his eyes closed
and move his fingers over the object. He will most likely identify
it at once. By allowing the fingers to move, you have added time
to the sensory perception of touch. There is a direct analogy
between the fovea at the center of your retina and your
fingertips, both of which have high acuity. Your ability to
make complex use of touch, such as buttoning your shirt or
unlocking your front door in the dark, depends on continuous
time-varying patterns of touch sensation."
2020,Context,Q24,"A defining element of catastrophes is the magnitude of their
harmful consequences. To help societies prevent or reduce
damage from catastrophes, a huge amount of effort and
technological sophistication are often employed to assess and
communicate the size and scope of potential or actual losses.
This effort assumes that people can understand the resulting
numbers and act on them appropriately. However, recent
behavioral research casts doubt on this fundamental assumption.
Many people do not understand large numbers. Indeed, large
numbers have been found to lack meaning and to be
underestimated in decisions unless they convey affect (feeling).
This creates a paradox that rational models of decision making
fail to represent. On the one hand, we respond strongly to aid a
single individual in need. On the other hand, we often fail to
prevent mass tragedies or take appropriate measures to reduce
potential losses from natural disasters."

2018,Context,Q24,"Individual authors and photographers have rights to their
intellectual property during their lifetimes, and their heirs
have rights for 70 years after the creator_s death, so any
publication less than 125 years old has to be checked for its
copyright status. The duration of copyright protection has
increased steadily over the years; the life-plus-70-years
standard was set by the Copyright Term Extension Act of
1998, which increased the 50-year limit established by the
1976 Copyright Act. Supporters of such legislation like to
defend these increases with tales of starving writers and their
impoverished descendants, but in reality the beneficiaries are
more likely to be transnational publishing companies. And
note that copyright laws serve a dual purpose. In addition to
protecting the rights of authors so as to encourage the
publication of new creative works, copyright is also supposed
to place reasonable time limits on those rights so that
outdated works may be incorporated into new creative efforts.
Therefore, the extended copyright protection frustrates new
creative endeavors such as including poetry and song lyrics
on Internet sites."
2017,Context,Q24,"The film director, as compared to the theater director, has
as his material, the finished, recorded celluloid. This material
from which his final work is composed consists not of living
men or real landscapes, not of real, actual stage-sets, but only
of their images, recorded on separate strips that can be
shortened, altered, and assembled according to his will. The
elements of reality are fixed on these pieces; by combining
them in his selected sequence, shortening and lengthening
them according to his desire, the director builds up his own
filmic time and filmic space. He does not adapt reality,
but uses it for the creation of a new reality, and the most
characteristic and important aspect of this process is that, in it,
laws of space and time invariable and inescapable in work
with actuality become obedient. The film assembles from
them a new reality proper only to itself."
2016,Context,Q24,"When we remark with surprise that someone looks young
for his or her chronological age, we are observing that we
all age biologically at different rates. Scientists have good
evidence that this apparent difference is real. It is likely that age
changes begin in different parts of the body at different times
and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells,
tissues, and organs, as well as from person to person. Unlike
the passage of time, biological aging resists easy measurement.
What we would like to have is one or a few measurable
biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes
without reference to the passage of time, so that we could say,
for example, that someone who is chronologically eighty years
old is biologically sixty years old. This kind of measurement
would help explain why one eighty-year-old has so many more
youthful qualities than does another eighty-year-old, who may
be biologically eighty or even ninety years old."
2015,Context,Q24,"The key to successful risk taking is to understand that the
actions you are taking should be the natural next step. One of
the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation
is our tendency to focus on the end result. Skiers who are
unsure of themselves often do this. They will go to the edge of a
difficult slope, look all the way down to the bottom, and
determine that the slope is too steep for them to try. The ones
that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what
they need to do to master the first step, like getting through
the first mogul on the hill. Once they get there, they
concentrate on the next mogul, and over the course of the run,
they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an
impossible mountain."
2022,Context,Q23,"Scientists use paradigms rather than believing them. The use
of a paradigm in research typically addresses related problems
by employing shared concepts, symbolic expressions,
experimental and mathematical tools and procedures, and even
some of the same theoretical statements. Scientists need only
understand how to use these various elements in ways that
others would accept. These elements of shared practice thus
need not presuppose any comparable unity in scientists beliefs
about what they are doing when they use them. Indeed, one role
of a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully
without having to provide a detailed account of what they are
doing or what they believe about it. Thomas Kuhn noted that
scientists can agree in their identification of a paradigm without
agreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a full interpretation
or rationalization of it. Lack of a standard interpretation or of
an agreed reduction to rules will not prevent a paradigm from
guiding research."
2021,Context,Q23,"Difficulties arise when we do not think of people and
machines as collaborative systems, but assign whatever tasks
can be automated to the machines and leave the rest to people.
This ends up requiring people to behave in machine-like
fashion, in ways that differ from human capabilities. We
expect people to monitor machines, which means keeping alert
for long periods, something we are bad at. We require people
to do repeated operations with the extreme precision and
accuracy required by machines, again something we are not
good at. When we divide up the machine and human
components of a task in this way, we fail to take advantage of
human strengths and capabilities but instead rely upon areas
where we are genetically, biologically unsuited. Yet, when
people fail, they are blamed."

2018,Context,Q23,"Sensory-specific satiety is defined as a decrease in appetite,
or the subjective liking for the food that is consumed, with
little change in the hedonics of uneaten food. As a result of
sensory-specific satiety, when people consume a variety of
foods, they tend to overeat. A greater variety of food leads
people to eat more than they would otherwise. So, being full
and feeling sated are separate matters. The recovery of
appetite or the motivation to eat is apparent to anyone who
has consumed a large meal and is quite full, and does not
require additional energy or nutrients to meet their daily
needs, but decides to consume additional calories after seeing
the dessert cart. Small changes in the sensory properties of
foods are sufficient to increase food intake. For example,
subjects who were presented with different shapes of pasta
showed increased hedonic ratings and increased energy
consumption relative to subjects eating only a single shape of
pasta."
2017,Context,Q23,"As a system for transmitting specific factual information
without any distortion or ambiguity, the sign system of
honey-bees would probably win easily over human language
every time. However, language offers something more
valuable than mere information exchange. Because the
meanings of words are not invariable and because
understanding always involves interpretation, the act of
communicating is always a joint, creative effort. Words can
carry meanings beyond those consciously intended by
speakers or writers because listeners or readers bring their own
perspectives to the language they encounter. Ideas expressed
imprecisely may be more intellectually stimulating for
listeners or readers than simple facts. The fact that language is
not always reliable for causing precise meanings to be generated
in someone else_s mind is a reflection of its powerful strength
as a medium for creating new understanding. It is the inherent
ambiguity and adaptability of language as a meaning-making
system that makes the relationship between language and
thinking so special."
2016,Context,Q23,"Twin sirens hide in the sea of history, tempting those
seeking to understand and appreciate the past onto the reefs of
misunderstanding and misinterpretation. These twin dangers

the belief that your times are the best of all possible times. All
other times are thus inferior. Ethnocentrism is the belief that
your culture is the best of all possible cultures. All other
cultures are thus inferior. Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism
unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other
individuals and cultures by the superior standards of their
current culture. This leads to a total lack of perspective when
dealing with past and / or foreign cultures and a resultant
misunderstanding and misappreciation of them. Temporocentrism

2015,Context,Q23,"At some time in their lives, most people pause to reflect on
their own moral principles and on the practical implications of
those principles, and they sometimes think about what
principles people should have or which moral standards can
be best justified. When a person accepts a moral principle,
naturally the person believes the principle is important and
well justified. But there is more to moral principles than that.
When a principle is part of a person_s moral code, that person
is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the
principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that
principle. The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her
own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of
others whose behavior conflicts with it. Likewise, the person
will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an
abundance of the motivation required by the principle."
2022,Context,Q22,"Environmental hazards include biological, physical, and
chemical ones, along with the human behaviors that promote
or allow exposure. Some environmental contaminants are
difficult to avoid (the breathing of polluted air, the drinking of
chemically contaminated public drinking water, noise in open
public spaces); in these circumstances, exposure is largely
involuntary. Reduction or elimination of these factors may require
societal action, such as public awareness and public health
measures. In many countries, the fact that some environmental
hazards are difficult to avoid at the individual level is felt to be
more morally egregious than those hazards that can be avoided.
Having no choice but to drink water contaminated with very
high levels of arsenic, or being forced to passively breathe in
tobacco smoke in restaurants, outrages people more than the
personal choice of whether an individual smokes tobacco.
These factors are important when one considers how change
(risk reduction) happens."
2021,Context,Q22,"Prior to file-sharing services, music albums landed exclusively
in the hands of music critics before their release. These critics
would listen to them well before the general public could and
preview them for the rest of the world in their reviews. Once
the internet made music easily accessible and allowed even
advanced releases to spread through online social networks,
availability of new music became democratized, which meant
critics no longer had unique access. That is, critics and
laypeople alike could obtain new music simultaneously. Social
media services also enabled people to publicize their views on
new songs, list their new favorite bands in their social media
bios, and argue over new music endlessly on message boards.
The result was that critics now could access the opinions of the
masses on a particular album before writing their reviews.
Thus, instead of music reviews guiding popular opinion toward
art (as they did in preinternet times), music reviews began to
reflect consciously or subconsciously public opinion."

2018,Context,Q22,"One exercise in teamwork I do at a company retreat is to
put the group in a circle. At one particular retreat, there were
eight people in the circle, and I slowly handed tennis balls to
one person to start throwing around the circle. If N equals the
number of people in the circle, then the maximum number of
balls you can have in motion is N minus 1. Why? Because it is
almost impossible to throw and catch at the same time. The
purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate the importance of an
individual_s action. People are much more concerned about
catching the ball than throwing it. What this demonstrates is
that it is equally important to the success of the exercise that
the person you are throwing to catches the ball as that you are
able to catch the ball. If you are less concerned about how you
deliver information than with how you receive it, you will
ultimately fail at delegation. You have to be equally skilled at
both."
2017,Context,Q22,"The precision of the lines on the map, the consistency with
which symbols are used, the grid and/or projection system, the
apparent certainty with which place names are written and
placed, and the legend and scale information all give the map
an aura of scientific accuracy and objectivity. Although
subjective interpretation goes into the construction of these
cartographic elements, the finished map appears to express an
authoritative truth about the world, separate from any interests
and influences. The very trust that this apparent objectivity
inspires is what makes maps such powerful carriers of ideology.
However unnoticeably, maps do indeed reflect the world views
of either their makers or, more probably, the supporters of their
makers, in addition to the political and social conditions under
which they were made. Some of the simple ideological
messages that maps can convey include: This land is and has

2016,Context,Q22,"The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades
have been documented with students from different cultures.
Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding
all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning,
we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people
across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction
with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather
than extrinsic. Another consistent research finding is that
when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain
some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least
demanding way of ensuring the reward. Since there are three
decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system
of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior
learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic
motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective
approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse
students."
2015,Context,Q22,"The most normal and competent child encounters what
seem like insurmountable problems in living. But by playing
them out, he may become able to cope with them in a
step-by-step process. He often does so in symbolic ways that
are hard for even him to understand, as he is reacting to inner
processes whose origin may be buried deep in his
unconscious. This may result in play that makes little sense to
us at the moment, since we do not know the purposes it
serves. When there is no immediate danger, it is usually best
to approve of the child_s play without interfering. Efforts to
assist him in his struggles, while well intentioned, may divert
him from seeking and eventually finding the solution that will

2022,Context,Q20,"when they first consider experimenting with social media is
that they focus too much on social media tools and platforms
and not enough on their business objectives. The reality of
success in the social web for businesses is that creating a social

the organization_s own goals and objectives. A social media
program is not merely the fulfillment of a vague need to manage
a presence on popular social networks because everyone
else is doing it. Being in social media serves no purpose
in and of itself. In order to serve any purpose at all, a social
media presence must either solve a problem for the organization
and its customers or result in an improvement of some sort
(preferably a measurable one). In all things, purpose drives

2021,Context,Q20,"Developing expertise carries costs of its own. We can
become experts in some areas, like speaking a language or

many other domains expertise requires considerable training

expertise that we work hard to acquire in one domain will
carry over only imperfectly to related ones, and not at all to
unrelated ones. In the end, as much as we may want to become
experts on everything in our lives, there simply is not enough
time to do so. Even in areas where we could, it will  not
necessarily be worth the effort. It is clear that we should
concentrate our own expertise on those domains of choice that

concept of the enemy is fundamental to the moral assessment
of war: The basic aim of a nation at war in establishing an
image of the enemy is to distinguish as sharply as possible the
act of killing from the act of murder. However, we need to be
cautious about thinking of war and the image of the enemy
that informs it in an abstract and uniform way. Rather, both
must be seen for the cultural and contingent phenomena that
they are."
2018,Context,Q20,"At the 2015 Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit, Ginni
Rometty offered this advice: When did you ever learn the
most in your life? What experience? I guarantee you will tell
me it was a time you felt at risk. To become a better leader,
you have to step out of your comfort zone. You have to
challenge the conventional ways of doing things and search for
opportunities to innovate. Exercising leadership not only
requires you to challenge the organizational status quo but
also requires you to challenge your internal status quo. You
have to challenge yourself. You have to venture beyond the
boundaries of your current experience and explore new
territory. Those are the places where there are opportunities to
improve, innovate, experiment, and grow. Growth is always
at the edges, just outside the boundaries of where you are
right now."
2017,Context,Q20,"Many present efforts to guard and maintain human
progress, to meet human needs, and to realize human
ambitions are simply unsustainable in both the rich and
poor nations. They draw too heavily, too quickly, on already
overdrawn environmental resource accounts to be affordable
far into the future without bankrupting those accounts. They
may show profit on the balance sheets of our generation, but
our children will inherit the losses. We borrow environmental
capital from future generations with no intention or prospect
of repaying. They may blame us for our wasteful ways, but
they can never collect on our debt to them. We act as we do
because we can get away with it: future generations do not
vote; they have no political or financial power; they cannot
challenge our decisions."
2016,Context,Q20,"Assertiveness may seem to some people to be uncharacteristic
of counselors. If your picture of a counselor is someone who
never disagrees, always goes along, wants everything to be
nice all the time, and only does what other people want him or
her to do, this is not a picture of an assertive counselor. Being
assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable. Being a
counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent
when someone tells a racist joke. An assertive counselor
would find a way to call that person_s attention to the fact
that the joke is racist, explaining how it offended the hearer,
and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided. Being
assertive is a highly developed skill it should fit nicely in
the counselor_s repertoire of techniques."
2015,Context,Q20,"Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the
doing than by mere abstract study. This is often the case with
the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical
disciplines. For example, within the philosophical disciplines,
logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual
problem solving. Only after some time and struggle does the
student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable
him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of
thinking. This learning by doing is essential in many of the
sciences. For instance, only after a good deal of observation do
the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the
specific movements of identifiable particles."
2022,Context,Q19,"It was Evelyn_s first time to explore the Badlands of
Alberta, famous across Canada for its numerous dinosaur
fossils. As a young amateur bone-hunter, she was overflowing
with anticipation. She had not travelled this far for the bones
of common dinosaur species. Her life-long dream to find rare
fossils of dinosaurs was about to come true. She began eagerly
searching for them. After many hours of wandering throughout
the deserted lands, however, she was unsuccessful. Now, the
sun was beginning to set, and her goal was still far beyond her
reach. Looking at the slowly darkening ground before her, she
sighed to herself, I cannot believe I came all this way for
nothing. What a waste of time!"
2021,Context,Q19,"Once again, I had lost the piano contest to my friend. When
I learned that Linda had won, I was deeply troubled and
unhappy. My body was shaking with uneasiness. My heart

the concert hall to settle down. Sitting on the stairs alone, I
recalled what my teacher had said. Life is about winning, not
necessarily about winning against others but winning at being
you. And the way to win is to figure out who you are and do
your best. He was absolutely right. I had no reason to oppose
my friend. Instead, I should focus on myself and my own
improvement. I breathed out slowly. My hands were steady
now. At last, my mind was at peace."

None of the wildlife I saw was exotic. I could only see dull
gray rocks. It was also so hot and humid that I could not
enjoy the tour fully. However, as the boat slid into the Bay
Park Canal, all of a sudden my mother shouted, Look at the
mangroves! A whole new world came into sight. The
mangrove forest alongside the canal thrilled me as we entered
its cool shade. I was fascinated by the beautiful leaves and
flowers of the mangroves. But best of all, I was charmed by
the native birds, monkeys, and lizards moving among the
branches. What a wonderful adventure! I exclaimed."

waiting to be touched. His mom was holding his hand.
Breaden, her only child, had always been the focus of her

Suddenly, she stopped to say hello to her friends. Breaden
stopped, too. With his eyes wide open and his mouth watering,
Breaden stretched out his arm and was about to grab a bar

not today! He knew what that meant. Okay, Mommy, he
sighed. His shoulders fell."

a dozen species of monkeys, and numerous colorful butterflies

My name is Christina Markle, Bradley Markle_s mother.
Bradley and I were thrilled to learn that you are holding
your Gymnastics Summer Camp again this year. So I
did not hesitate to sign up and pay the non-refundable
deposit for the second week program, which is from July
13 to 17. But today I remembered that our family is
going to get back from a trip on July 13, and I am afraid
Bradley will  not be able to make it on the very first day of
the program. Rather than make him skip the day, I would like
to check to see if he could switch to the third week
program. Please let us know if that is possible. Thank you.

2015,Context,Q18,"One difference between winners and losers is how they handle
losing. Even for the best companies and most accomplished
professionals, long track records of success are punctuated by
slips, slides, and mini-turnarounds. Even the team that wins
the game might make mistakes and lag behind for part of it.
That is why the ability to recover quickly is so important.
Troubles are ubiquitous. Surprises can fall from the sky like
volcanic ash and appear to change everything. That is why one
prominent scholar said, Anything can look like a failure in
the middle. Thus, a key factor in high achievement is
bouncing back from the low points."
