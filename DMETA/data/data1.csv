1,Implementing digital multimodal composing in L2 writing instruction: a focus on developing L2 student writers,digital multimodal composing; teaching innovation; developing L2 student writers; L2 writing; new literacy,MULTILITERACIES,"This article introduced a teaching innovation practice, i.e., digital multimodal composing, in College English course in mainland China. The purpose of this practice is to respond to the developing L2 student writers' difficulty of lacking linguistic resources to express their creative ideas, and empower them to leverage multiple modes other than the language mode to make their meaning, and meanwhile to raise their interest, motivation, and enjoyment in L2 writing. Data were collected from student interviews in conjunction with DMC samples. It was reported that a majority of the developing L2 student writers positively perceived the affordances of DMC, that is, having access to multiple modes to fully express creative ideas, feeling more enjoyable and less anxious in L2 writing, being more motivated to interact with authentic audiences, and forming the habit of constantly revising scripts. This points to important pedagogical implications for the future implementation of digital multimodal composing projects by launching individual digital multimodal composing tasks, constructing and validating DMC rubrics, and enhancing collaboration between teachers and researchers to bring innovative DMC pedagogy into L2 writing instruction practice.",2023
2,Conceptualizing digital multimodal composing competence in L2 classroom: a qualitative inquiry,Digital multimodal composing (DMC); L2 learners; writing assessment; digital writing competence; writing instruction,ENGLISH; VIDEO; MULTILITERACIES; ADOLESCENT; PEDAGOGY; PROJECT,"While research on digital multimodal composing (DMC) has been skewed towards the instructional design and affordances of DMC for L2 learners, there is a wider need to develop conceptual models of L2 DMC competence, with which L2 learners can successfully design DMC works and respond to the multimodal reading and writing demands of the digital era. To date, the studies on DMC competence have primarily taken an etic approach to identifying the salient features of effective DMC samples or examining teachers' perceptions of L2 student DMC competence. Few, however, have taken an emic approach to capturing the DMC competence from the perspective of L2 learners who have first-hand participatory experiences in designing DMC works. Therefore, the present study addresses the research gap by taking an emic approach to examining L2 student DMC competence through student focus group interviews with ten groups of students, classroom observations of student self and peer feedback on digital multimodal compositions, and DMC sample analysis. The clarification of L2 DMC competence can guide the measurement and instruction of L2 DMC competence, promote the integration of DMC competence into the L2 curriculum, and drive L2 learners to engage with self-assessment of DMC competence to develop their DMC competence.",2023
3,Patterns of peer interaction in multimodal L2 digital social reading,Digital Social Reading; Multiliteracies; Instructional Pragmatics; L2 Reading,CRITICAL THINKING; LANGUAGE; MULTILITERACIES; AFFORDANCES; ENVIRONMENT,"Although L2 reading is traditionally framed as an individual enterprise, digital annotation tools (DATs) have recently been developed allowing groups of readers to collaborate and provide mutual scaffolding through collective annotation of texts (Blyth, 2014; Thoms, Sung, & Poole, 2017). These tools reframe L2 reading as an interactive process where meaning is socially constructed. Digital social reading supports a multiliteracies approach to teaching L2 pragmatics. This study investigates interactional patterns in social reading across multiple groups of learners. In total, 215 students enrolled in 11 sections of a beginning university French course used the DAT eComma to annotate six L2 songs over three months. We performed a mixed-methods analysis of the annotations. Social engagement, as measured by the frequency of questions and replies as well as word count, decreased over time, and the use of linguistic affordances increased in later songs. However, these patterns were highly variable across the sections. Language choice, social engagement and register, among other factors, were influenced by the shared practices of members of each section. Through their interactions, participants co-constructed meaning about the texts themselves as well as broader cultural and pragmatic questions. Instructors reported that engagement in class discussion corresponded to that of the online discussion.",2020
4,Understanding L2 use in MMOGs: A linguistic framework of digital gaming,computer-assisted language learning; digital game-based L2 learning; digital gaming framework; massive-multiplayer online games,GAME; ENGLISH; PLAY; WORLD,"The L2 learning potentials of massive multiplayer online games (MMOGs) have been established in various studies; however, the fine-grained dynamics of digital game-based L2 learning are yet to be uncovered. A potential cause of this limitation is a limited understanding of the interconnected, situated, and dynamic nature of digital gaming as a context for L2 use and practice. To shed light on this underexplored research territory, the present study adopts a theoretical approach to conceptualizing digital gaming in MMOGs as a dynamic, multilayered context for L2 use and practice. Informed by multidisciplinary research on digital gaming, and framed in Activity Theory, this paper proposes a dynamic and ecological linguistic framework of digital gaming activities in MMOGs. The framework conceptualizes digital, game-based L2 practice as a dynamic process of drawing on available linguistic and semiotic resources to learn a game rules and manage gameplay. The paper also applies the framework as an analytical lens to an existing study to demonstrate its merit for current and future research and discusses it implications for future research and practice.",2022
5,Modeling EFL learners' willingness to communicate: The roles of face-to-face and digital L2 communication anxiety,Face-to-face L2 communication anxiety; digital L2 communication anxiety; willingness to communicate in a second language,LANGUAGE ANXIETY; MOTIVATION; ENGLISH,"This study proposes and tests a comprehensive model (with demographics, informal digital learning of English, ideal/ought-to L2 self, L2 enjoyment, and self-perceived communication competence) of face-to-face and digital communication anxiety's relationship to willingness to communicate in a second language (L2 WTC) within in-class, out-of-class, and digital contexts. A structural equation model of survey responses from 1,269 Koreans learning English as a foreign language (746 secondary and 523 university students) showed that in all three settings, students with lower anxiety showed greater L2 WTC. Within in-class and out-of-class contexts, students with higher self-perceived English ability had lower face-to-face anxiety, which in turn yielded higher L2 WTC. In digital settings, students with a higher ideal L2 self (i.e., a more positive evaluation of their ability to attain the ideal L2 self) showed less overall anxiety (comprising face-to-face and digital anxieties), which yielded greater L2 WTC. These results suggest that future studies can test whether interventions to lower anxiety can increase L2 WTC across communication venues.",2023
6,Second language (L2) gains through digital game-based language learning (DGBLL): A meta-analysis,Digital Game-based Language Learning; Meta-analysis; Digital Games; L2 Learning Outcomes,VIDEO GAMES; VOCABULARY; ENGLISH; INSTRUCTION; CLASSROOM; IMPACT; SIMS,"Studies on digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) have increased in numbers, creating a pool of studies that can be meta-analyzed to measure the overall effect of digital gaming on second language (L2) development. The current meta-analysis targets digital games that were available to the public at the time of data collection, January of 2020, aggregating their effects on L2 development overall and across a number of moderator variables. These moderator variables include the game developers' intended purpose of the game (educational or entertainment), outcome measures (e.g., vocabulary, overall proficiency), and several game design features such as the type of player interaction (single player, multiplayer, massively multiplayer online), among others. Results indicate that DGBLL has had a small to medium positive effect (Cohen's d(weighted) = 0.50) for between-groups designs and a medium effect (d(weighted) = 0.95) for within- group designs. Games designed for entertainment were found to be more effective than those designed for L2 education, although there is some overlap in the 95% confidence intervals of the two groups. The overall findings and those from additional moderator analyses are discussed in light of previous DGBLL findings while offering direction for future research and recommendations for improving the methodological rigor and transparency in DGBLL research.",2022
7,Reexamining feedback on L2 digital writing,digital multimodal composing; digital feedback for multimodal texts; nonlinguistic feedback; assessment rubrics; literacies,MULTIMODAL ASSESSMENT; GENRE; COMMUNICATION; LITERACIES; SCIENCE; DESIGN; TOOLS,"The integration of digital multimodal composing (DMC) in the second language (L2) and heritage language (HL) classrooms has expanded our notion of writing, shifting from a focus on the written mode to include other modes of expression (e.g., visual, textual, or aural). Notwithstanding the increasing presence of L2 multimodal learning tasks, which combine different semiotic resources (e.g., language and visual compo-nents such as images or videos) as intrinsic elements used to generate meaning, in-structors have not yet modified the way in which they provide feedback. That is, de-spite the increasing integration of different modes in a multimodal task, instructors still focus exclusively on language development - replicating the feedback behaviors modeled by non-digital writing assignments - rather than on all the components of multimodal texts. In digitally influenced environments and societies, however, there is a need to reconsider our approaches to feedback to pay greater attention to the linguistic and nonlinguistic elements of DMC. With the scarcity of research on feed-back in DMC, this article first identifies a gap in multimodal teaching and research regarding the role and focus on feedback in DMC, and, second, provides an assess-ment rubric from which to base formative feedback that addresses both linguistic and nonlinguistic elements to help students develop their multimodal texts.",2022
8,Out-of-school digital gameplay and in-school L2 English vocabulary outcomes,L2 vocabulary acquisition; Informal learning; Incidental learning; Gender; CALL; COTS games; Digital games,VIDEO GAME; LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION; CHALLENGES,"The aim of the present study is to examine the relation between out-of-school digital gameplay and in-school L2 English vocabulary measures and grading outcomes. Data were originally collected from a sample of 80 teenage Swedish L2 English learners and comprise a questionnaire, language diaries, vocabulary tests, assessed essays, and grades. Using an observational post-hoc design, three Digital Game Groups (DGGs) were created based on frequency of gameplay: (1) non-gamers (0 h/week), (2) moderate gamers (<5 h/week), and (3) frequent gamers (>5 h/week). Results show that DGG3 had the highest rated essays, used the most advanced vocabulary in the essays, and had the highest grades, closely followed by DGG1, while DGG2 trailed behind. For the vocabulary tests, DGG3 was followed by DGG2 and DGG1, indicating that gameplay aligns more directly with vocabulary test scores than vocabulary indicators drawn from essays. Due to the gender distribution of non-gamers (predominantly girls) and frequent gamers (exclusively boys), a subsidiary aim is to investigate how gameplay correlates with outcomes for boys and girls: significant correlations were found for gameplay vocabulary tests/English grades for the boys.

9,"Informal digital learning of English and L2 willingness to communicate: roles of emotions, gender, and educational stage",Informal Digital Learning of English; willingness to communicate in a second language; L2 enjoyment; L2 anxiety; gender; educational stage,,"This study was conducted with two goals in mind: (1) to explore the mediating roles of L2 enjoyment as a positive emotion and L2 anxiety as a negative emotion in the relationship between Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) and L2 willingness to communicate (L2 WTC) in an exam-oriented EFL context, and (2) to further examine whether gender and educational stage play any role in these relationships. Participants include 1,265 Korean EFL learners (764 secondary and 501 tertiary students; 400 males and 865 females). Moderated mediation structural equation modelling results found: (1) L2 enjoyment and L2 anxiety partially mediated the relationship between IDLE and L2 WTC. L2 enjoyment was a stronger mediator than L2 anxiety; (2) IDLE affected females more than males in terms of reducing their L2 anxiety; (3) L2 emotions played a similar mediation role for secondary and tertiary students. These findings advance our understanding of how emotions mediate the association between IDLE and L2 WTC in relation to individual and contextual differences.",2021
10,Digital innovations in L2 motivation: Harnessing the power of the Ideal L2 Self,Motivation; Ideal self; Digital animation; Avatar; Computer-assisted language learning,TECHNOLOGY; ENGLISH; SELVES,"Sustained motivation is crucial to learning a second language (L2), and one way to support this can be through the mental visualisation of ideal L2 selves (Dornyei & Kubanyiova, 2014). This paper reports on an exploratory study which investigated the possibility of using technology to create representations of language learners' ideal L2 selves digitally. Nine Chinese learners of L2 English were invited to three semi-structured interviews to discuss their ideal L2 selves and their future language goals, as well as their opinions on several different technological approaches to representing their ideal L2 selves. Three approaches were shown to participants: (a) 2D and 3D animations, (b) Facial Overlay, and (c) Facial Mask. Within these, several iterations were also included (e.g. with/without background or context). Results indicate that 3D animation currently offers the best approach in terms of realism and animation of facial features, and improvements to Facial Overlay could lead to beneficial results in the future. Approaches using the 2D animations and the Facial Mask approach appeared to have little future potential. The descriptive details of learners' ideal L2 selves also provide preliminary directions for the development of content that might be included in future technology-based interventions.

11,Commercial-off-the-shelf games in the digital wild and L2 learner vocabulary,Gaming; L2 Vocabulary; Digital Wild; Extramural English,FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; ENGLISH,"The purposes of this study are to examine the relation between playing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games in the wild and L2 English vocabulary and to offer comparisons with non-gamers' vocabulary. Data were collected from two samples of teenage L2 English learners in Sweden, Sample A (N = 1,069) and Sample B (N = 16). Questionnaires and English grades were collected from A and B, productive and receptive vocabulary tests from A, and interviews and essays from B. A quantitative-dominant mixed-methods approach was adopted. Results showed a significant positive correlation between time played and test scores. They also showed that time played was related to types of games played. Multiple regression analysis including time played and types of games as predictor variables and L2 vocabulary as the outcome variable showed that the effect from type disappeared when it was entered into the model, whereas time remained significant. A close examination of 45 words (productive test) revealed significantly higher scores for gamers (compared with non-gamers) at all vocabulary frequency levels, and for particularly difficult words. Overall, findings from Sample B regarding gaming habits and vocabulary (i.e., use of advanced or infrequent words in essays) reflected the results from Sample A, making it possible to conclude that playing COTS games matters for L2 learner vocabulary.",2019
12,Gaming as extramural English L2 learning and L2 proficiency among young learners,digital games; extramural English; l2 proficiency; second language acquisition; motivation; incidental vocabulary acquisition,2ND-LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION; VOCABULARY; LANGUAGE; GAME; GENDER; INPUT,"Today, playing digital games is an important part of many young people's everyday lives. Claims have been made that certain games, in particular massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) provide L2 English learners with a linguistically rich and cognitively challenging virtual environment that may be conducive to L2 learning, as learners get ample opportunities for L2 input and scaffolded interaction in the L2. In this paper, we present empirical evidence that L2 English proficiency correlates with the frequency of gaming and types of games played. We base our observation on a study among young L2 English learners (N = 86, aged 11-12, Sweden). Data were collected through a questionnaire, a language diary, and three proficiency tests. The questionnaire provided demographic background information but was also targeted at measuring extramural English habits, i.e., learners' out-of-school contact with English (cf. Sundqvist, 2009). The diary measured how much time the learners spent on seven pre-determined extramural English activities during one week, while the tests measured their achieved L2 proficiency regarding reading and listening comprehension, and vocabulary. Previous research among learners aged 15-16 (Sundqvist, 2009) showed positive correlations between playing digital games and L2 proficiency, in particular with regard to vocabulary, and also identified gender-related differences regarding vocabulary (boys outperformed girls) as well as the frequency of gaming and types of games played. These results were corroborated in the present study. A clear pattern emerged from our data: frequent gamers (>= 5 hours/week) outperformed moderate gamers who, in turn, outperformed non-gamers. Background variables could not explain the between-group differences. Even though the boys might have been more proficient or apt than the girls a priori and, therefore, chose to engage more in L2 gaming, the findings suggest that playing digital games at an early age can be important for L2 acquisition.",2012
13,L2 motivational self system and willingness to communicate in the classroom and extramural digital contexts,Ideal L2 self; motivational self system; willingness to communicate in an extramural digital context; willingness to communicate in a second language; young EFL learners,EFL LEARNERS WILLINGNESS; OUT-OF-CLASS; AFFECTIVE VARIABLES; IN-CLASS; ENGLISH; 2ND-LANGUAGE; MODEL; BEHAVIOR; ANXIETY,"This study explores the relationship between the L2 Motivational Self System-namely, the ideal L2 self and the ought-to L2 self-and L2 Willingness to Communicate (L2 WTC) in the classroom (a typical place for English communication among EFL learners) and in the extramural digital setting (an emerging English communication channel increasingly used by young EFL learners). To this end, 417 Chinese EFL middle school students (ages 12 to 14) participated in the study. After controlling for demographic factors hierarchical multiple regression results showed that the ideal L2 self significantly predicted L2 WTC both in the classroom and in an extramural digital setting. Interview data (n = 4) also elaborated that students attempted to lessen the discrepancy between their current L2 self (e.g., EFL learners) and ideal L2 self-images (e.g., discussing the professional National Basketball Association in an American radio program) by becoming more willing to communicate in both communication environments. In addition to new research directions, these results offer pedagogical implications that the ideal L2 self can facilitate L2 communication orientation in in-class and out-of-class digital environments, both of which are typically venues for L2 communication among today's young EFL learners.",2023

The limitations common in traditional face-to-face classrooms have brought researchers in the field of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) to recognize that technology can provide environments to expose language learners to a larger variety of sociopragmatic situations and contexts to test and develop their L2 pragmatic competence. This article presents a historical overview of the tools and digital spaces that have been explored for the teaching and the research of L2 pragmatics. Pedagogical practices that have evolved from presentational to more interactive are then briefly discussed. The article ends with a look into what the future may bring for the field of technology mediated L2 pragmatics.",2021
15,Digital Multimodal Composing in L2 Learning: Ideologies and Impact,Digital multimodal composing; ideologies; impact; investment,ENGLISH; IDENTITY; LITERACY; LEARNERS; VOICE,"While there has been a scholarly call for the incorporation of digital multimodal composing (DMC) in L2 pedagogy over the past decade, the ideologies of teachers and students about using DMC and the pertinent impact on students' investment in language learning remain underexplored. This paper is concerned with the experiences of a group of English teachers and students when they participated in a DMC program that engaged students with video production in a university-based English course in China. Relying on multiple sources of data, the study revealed that teachers and students had different, and sometimes even contrasting, ideologies over the nature of language, the role of teachers, and the legitimate evidence of learning during DMC. A framework is proposed to illustrate how the different and contrasting ideologies created unintended barriers to students' investment in English learning at both micro and macro levels.",2021
16,The assessment of memes as digital multimodal composition in L2 classrooms,Memes; Digital multimodal composition; Korean as a foreign language; Assessment,,"Digital multimodal writing has become predominant in our students' lives in and outside the L2 classrooms. While many L2 educators integrate various multimodal projects into their curriculum, internet memes and their assessment have not been explored in depth in L2 settings, although memes have potential to be valuable multimodal writing tasks. The purpose of this study is to better understand how memes can be incorporated and assessed in L2 classrooms. Twenty-seven student-created memes in a low-intermediate Korean as a Foreign Language course at a large university were collected and analyzed. The findings indicated that the student-created memes successfully addressed the multimodal aspect of the meme genre, universal and specific cultural references, and language aspects specific to the genre of memes. Our analyses of the memes suggest three key components to assess this multimodal writing project in addition to its overall task/functions: 1) multimodal aspects that include understanding the interplay between multiple modes for an effective message in a given context; 2) cultural aspects, demonstrating cultural knowledge and its application, recognizing the semiotic importance of multimodal expression in the target community; and 3) language aspects as an effective communication medium, demonstrating genre knowledge of the specific task and language accuracy.",2022
17,"Autonomy in the Digital Wilds: Agency, Competence, and Self-efficacy in the Development of L2 Digital Identities",,LANGUAGE; ONLINE; ENGLISH; TECHNOLOGIES; LITERACY; DYNAMICS; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS,"The term digital wilds has come to refer to the non-formal online spaces in and through which additional language (L2) learner-users, using a multifarious array of tools, platforms, and services, autonomously navigate personal learning trajectories (Sauro & Zourou, 2019), developing L2 digital literacies-mediated identities needed in life-wide settings. This article examined how three successful, autonomous English L2 learner-users critically and creatively engaged in L2 digital literacy practices, ranging from navigating social media and the Internet to 'reprodusing' (Reinhardt & Thorne, 2019) content on video-sharing sites. This article focuses on (1) the development of digital learner autonomy in successful English L2 learners and (2) the entanglement of L2 digital literacy practices, identities, and livelihoods. The analysis shows that agency, competence, and self-efficacy played key roles in autonomy development, which was inextricably intertwined with emergent identities and realized through the practice of digital literacies. The findings shed light on the potential role of language educators in leveraging activity in the digital wilds for formal learning purposes.",2022
18,Profiling the affective characteristics of EFL learners' digital informal learning: A person-centered approach,Informal digital learning of English; L2 motivation; L2 enjoyment; L2 anxiety; grit; person-centered approach,OUT-OF-CLASS; POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY; IN-CLASS; ENGLISH; VARIABLES; WILLINGNESS; COMMUNICATE; ENJOYMENT; AUTONOMY; ANXIETY,"Purpose This study (1) used a person-centered approach to identify specific subgroups of 1,265 EFL learners who participated in Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) activities, and (2) looked at how different IDLE profiles are related to important affective variables. Design/Methodology : To identify IDLE profiles, we used cluster analysis. Findings The L2 motivation, L2 enjoyment, L2 anxiety, and grit levels of the IDLErs with distinct profiles differed significantly. When compared to Profiles 1 (Minimal IDLErs: 33%), 2 (Gaming-Entertainment IDLErs: 16%), and 3 (Entertainment IDLErs: 30%), both Profile 4 (Maximal IDLErs: 11%) and Profile 5 (Entertainment-socializing IDLErs: 10%) demonstrated significantly higher scores on Ideal L2 self, L2 enjoyment-self, L2 enjoyment-others, L2 communication anxiety-offline, and Grit. Profiles 4 and 5 made full use of out-of-school digital environment, which provided several affective benefits for EFL learners. Originality/value Methodologically, the analytical and statistical approach could help to move informal language learning research one step closer to being more person-centered. In practice, the various IDLE profiles identified in this study may be of interest to EFL teachers in order to better understand their students' IDLE activities outside of school and to inform classroom teaching and learning.",2023
19,"Native language, L2 experience, and pitch processing in music",music advantage; tone language; L2; L2 proficiency,TRAINING JAPANESE LISTENERS; LONG-TERM RETENTION; R-VERTICAL-BAR; TONE PERCEPTION; 2ND-LANGUAGE; PROFICIENCY; IDENTIFICATION; BILINGUALS; PLASTICITY; SPEAKERS,"The current study investigated how the role of pitch in one's native language and L2 experience influenced musical melodic processing by testing Turkish and Mandarin Chinese advanced and beginning learners of English as an L2. Pitch has a lower functional load and shows a simpler pattern in Turkish than in Chinese as the former only contrasts between presence and the absence of pitch elevation, while the latter makes use of four different pitch contours lexically. Using the Musical Ear Test as the tool, we found that the Chinese listeners outperformed the Turkish listeners, and the advanced L2 learners outperformed the beginning learners. The Turkish listeners were further tested on their discrimination of bisyllabic Chinese lexical tones, and again an L2 advantage was observed. No significant difference was found for working memory between the beginning and advanced L2 learners. These results suggest that richness of tonal inventory of the native language is essential for triggering a music processing advantage, and on top of the tone language advantage, the L2 experience yields a further enhancement. Yet, unlike the tone language advantage that seems to relate to pitch expertise, learning an L2 seems to improve sound discrimination in general, and such improvement exhibits in non-native lexical tone discrimination.",2023
20,Motivational elements of digital instructional games: A study of young L2 learners' game designs,Task-based language teaching; young learners; motivation; computer games; digital games; task design,FANTASY,"This article focuses on the design of digital instructional game (DIG) tasks for young second language (L2) learners. The aim of the study is to identify motivational task elements based on what children respond to positively in games and incorporate into their own L2 vocabulary learning game designs. Eighty-two sixth-grade students (ages 11-12 years) in Japan were first asked to identify game elements by examining existing games and then to design games incorporating DIG tasks of their own and peer-evaluate them. Building on previous work (Butler, 2015), the study uses a mixed-methods approach to examine how both task-intrinsic characteristics and implementation conditions were realized in innovative and engaging DIG tasks by children. Although the study focuses on young learners, the findings might be applied to any type of task, including both digital and physical tasks for adults as well as for children. The article concludes with suggestions for how to design instructional materials which allow individualized learning and encourage autonomy in order to cater to the genuine interests of learners and to invoke intrinsic motivation for learning.",2017
21,The development and validation of an L2 student digital multimodal composing competence scale,,ENGLISH; VALIDITY; MULTILITERACIES; LITERACIES; ADOLESCENT; PEDAGOGY; MEDIA,"In this digital age, digital multimodal composing (DMC) has permeated the L2 classroom as a technology-enhanced L2 writing task. Despite the learning potential of DMC for L2 students, instruments that measure L2 students' DMC competence are rare. As such, the present study sought to develop and validate an L2 student DMC competence scale in the mainland Chinese context. Data were collected from 513 Chinese L2 students' self-reported data on the DMC competence scale. The construct validity of the scale was scrutinized by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA results supported a five-factor 20-item model of the scale, which comprises digital skills, creativity, genre awareness, language use, and cohesion of modes. CFA analysis and expert judgment yielded a four-factor 15-item model, entailing digital skills, genre awareness, language use, and cohesion of modes. This study clarifies the construct of L2 student DMC competence and provides researchers with a robust instrument for measuring this construct, and teachers with a tool for evaluating the effect of DMC intervention and guiding the formative assessment of DMC projects. Students could also use the scale as a self-assessment tool to raise their metacognitive awareness of DMC competence, which helps them autonomously develop this competence.",2023

23,"L2 IDENTITY, DISCOURSE, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING IN RUSSIAN",L2 Identity; Social Networking; Computer-Mediated Communication; Virtual Environments; Discourse Analysis,,"As the integration of Internet-based social networking tools becomes increasingly popular in foreign language classrooms, the use of modern communication technologies is particularly critical in the context of less commonly taught languages (LCTLs), where student exposure to the target language and its speakers is usually minimal. This paper describes communicative exchanges between native speakers and non-native speakers (NS-NNS) in a telecollaborative project that spanned two semesters and brought a rich and authentic social networking community, VKontakte, into college-level Russian classes in the United States. The analysis of the students' online activities, phenomenological interviews, and interactions with Russian keypals grounded in the principles of identity construction through interaction (Bucholtz & Hall, 2005) and Discourse Analysis Framework (Gee, 2005) shed light on the students' emerging online second language (L2) identities along the continuum from L2 learners to L2 users. Along with global and local categories of L2 identity enactment in virtual social spaces, we bring into focus the notions of digital wisdom (Prensky, 2009) and investment (Norton, 2000), while exploring the ways in which learners of LCTLs, such as Russian, draw on Internet mediation in order to compensate for the lack of contact with the L2 and to extend social connections beyond the confines of a language classroom.",2013
24,Models as written corrective feedback: Effects on young L2 learners' fluency in digital writing from product and process perspectives,written corrective feedback; models; fluency; L2 writing; young learners,ACCURACY; COMPLEXITY,"This study was motivated by Truscott's (1996, 2004) scarcely empirically tested claims that written corrective feedback (WCF) processing hinders fluency in subse-quent rewriting owing to learners' purposeful avoidance of making mistakes by composing shorter texts at a higher speed. It examined the writing fluency of the texts produced by eighteen 10-11-year-old L2 English children in a digital environ-ment. They were divided into a feedback (N = 10) and a self-correction group (N = 8). Both groups engaged in a three-stage task: writing, comparison of their texts with a model or self-editing as appropriate, and rewriting. Fluency was analyzed via five product/offline and five process/online measures. The texts and writing behaviors were recorded with Inputlog 8.0. The results partially support Truscott's claims. The feedback group improved their fluency in all the ten measures. However, the self - editing group showed higher fluency than the feedback group in seven of the ten measures, with the corresponding Hedge's effect sizes between groups ranging from small to large. The study enlightens our knowledge of young learners' writing fluency and supports adopting a multidimensional approach to understand the complex and multi-faceted nature of fluency as mediated by WCF processing.",2022

Learning to be pragmatically appropriate in the second language (L2) is not easy, and although it is possible without instruction, research shows that instruction helps development (Plonsky & Zhuang, 2019). This article advocates that technology-mediated tasks are an excellent and effective pedagogic tool to promote L2 pragmatic development. The article will introduce some key findings of studies that incorporate technology and pragmatics as well as those that have investigated tasks and L2 pragmatics to then focus on those studies that incorporate the three elements: tasks, technology and L2 pragmatics. These studies are grouped by their main focus of investigation: (1) the task, (2) the technology, or (3) the L2 pragmatic feature. As a whole, these studies show the possibilities that tasks and technology-mediated contexts have to engage learners in discursive practices that may not be possible otherwise, exposing them to the cyberpragmatics of an ever-growing digital world. Finally, lines of new research to advance the field are suggested.",2022

In addition, although L2 pragmatics has mainly investigated speech acts, self-praise has not been examined from the L2 perspective. Therefore, this study investigates instances of self-praise posted by learners of Chinese on social networking sites. Data were collected from 20 advanced learners of Chinese who were asked to share instances of self-praise they posted on their WeChat Moments. Altogether, 61 learners' self-praise posts in L2 Chinese and 100 instances of self-praise from 20 Chinese native speakers were collected. The learners' Chinese self-praise was analyzed in terms of different pragmatic strategies and emoji uses, with comparisons against the native speakers' practices. Similarities and differences were analyzed between the two groups' self-praise strategies and their emoji use in self-praise posts. The findings showed that the advanced learners were able to employ the three major types of self-praise strategies in their self-praise posts on WeChat Moments. However, their repertoires of individual self-praise strategies and emojis were not as wide as those of native speakers. In addition, the learners showed divergences from the native speakers in terms of their preferred self-praise strategies and culture-relevant emojis.",2023

Participants included 176 Korean undergraduate and graduate students of English as a foreign language (EFL). After adjusting for demographic factors, hierarchical regression analyses revealed three major results: first, those with higher levels of L2 motivation and grit as well as a lower level of L2 speaking anxiety had higher L2 WTC inside the classroom. Second, students who majored in English and had higher levels of L2 self-confidence and risk-taking had higher L2 WTC outside the classroom. Third, individuals who were younger, had a higher level of L2 self-confidence and engaged more frequently in virtual intercultural experiences had higher L2 WTC in digital settings. Results suggest that demographic and affective variables as well as involvement in virtual intercultural activities play distinct roles in influencing EFL students' WTC in three different L2 communication contexts. Based on these findings, this study provides pedagogical suggestions for L2 practitioners.",2020
28,Beyond elocution: Multimodal narrative discourse analysis of L2 storytelling,digital storytelling; multimodality; narrative discourse; Second Life; storytelling style,2ND-LIFE; STORY; LIFE,"Drawing upon research on narrative and speech styles and on digital and multimodal communication, the author proposes multimodal narrative discourse analysis (MNDA) with associated pedagogical and analytical procedures to teach and study storytelling. The second language (L2) students first participated in multimodal narrative simulations in the virtual world of Second Life. The university students then presented, evaluated, and revised stories in both face-to-face and digital contexts through multiple modalities and technologies. MNDA further provided tools and methods for analyzing the students' discursive processes and agentive experiences of L2 storytelling. The results of MNDA showed that the proper use of narrative elements, discourse structures, and stylistic devices, as well as bodily, visual, and video resources, assisted the students in developing multimodal designs and storytelling styles. This technology-mediated discourse approach to L2 storytelling suggests the importance of teaching and researching broader narrative contexts and activities other than simply elocution in multimodal communicative activities.",2019

Although outside-of-class literacy exposure from these digital games has been recognized due to their popularity, the specifics of how digital games affect JFL digital literacies and how they interplay with JFL learners' motivations have not yet been fully explored. Thus, this study investigated the literacies around game fandoms for JFL learners in a Japanese language program (n = 191) and the self-directed and group-based learning activities of a game focus group (n = 6) with two commercial games. The findings demonstrated JFL learners' literacy exposure through Japanese games and revealed JFL learners' unique issues with kanji, furigana, and honorifics. Additionally, digital games in Japanese have roles in supporting JFL learners' motivations (a) visually achievement milestones (i.e., progress markers) within game content and (b) as goals that JFL learners for accessing and playing target game titles both as gamers and as JFL learners. Moreover, the study highlights the importance for higher education to connect in-class and non-formal learning and to support L2 learners with 21st century skills.",2023

It also examines if interactive and noninteractive out-of-class L2 contact function differently in the structural model. Data were collected from 1,922 college students taking Chinese, French, Russian, and Spanish language classes in the United States. Key findings suggest that (1) L2 interest, as one measure of integrativeness and intrinsic motivation, strongly drives L2 oral development. However, its effect is completely mediated by the perceived importance of speaking; (2) Out-of-class L2 contact, either interactive or noninteractive, significantly correlates with L2 interest but has no significant effect on L2 oral proficiency; (3) however, interactive and noninteractive out-of-class L2 contact still function differently in the structural relationship. Interactive language practice based on digital tools could play a promising role in future L2 learning. Pedagogical implications are presented in the discussion section.",2022

Data were collected using digital screen capture and eye-tracking technologies while participants wrote a 35-minute essay. Supplementary stimulated retrospective recalls were also conducted to document participants' reflections on the use of these tools during the full writing event. Results revealed that participants spent, on average, 15% of composing time consulting online tools, with bilingual resources the most used.

Drawing on a purposive sampling technique and an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, quantitative data (105 university and 112 high school students) were first collected and analyzed. Then, qualitative data (one focus group discussion with nine participants and five in-depth individual interviews) were collected and analyzed to further explain quantitative findings. Results showed that high school students, who exhibited stronger ideal L2 self and ought-to L2 self, had a higher level of L2 WTC inside and outside the classroom. In contrast, university students, who exhibited a stronger sense of ideal L2 self, had a higher level of L2 WTC in both communicative settings. While high-stakes English tests still seem to shape EFL secondary students' motivational mindset (ought-to L2 self), this study also suggests that pedagogical supports, such as offering performance-based English tasks, cultivating one's ideal L2 self image, and encouraging production-oriented English activities in out-of-class digital environments, could enhance contemporary students' L2 WTC in test-oriented EFL countries.",2020

A total of 391 Chinese university students participated in the survey, and 15 of them were interviewed later. Quantitative analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between the ideal L2 self and participants' IDLE, which was partially mediated by foreign language enjoyment (FLE), while the hypotheses that the ought-to L2 self significantly predicted FLE and IDLE were rejected. The qualitative data added details to how a vivid and elaborate L2 vision contributed to enhanced English learning enjoyment and served as the most influential motivator for IDLE practices. Meanwhile, the external and instrumental motives could not predict Chinese university students' enjoyment, disempowering them to invest in productive language learning practices in the informal and digitalized environment. The discussion of these findings and pedagogical implications helps to chart the path for utilizing the power of the ideal L2 self to engage Chinese university students with the extramural and digitalized language learning ecology.",2023

The psychometric testing of the revised L2 WTC (L2 WTC-R) was undertaken with 114 Indonesian EFL students by means of exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The results yielded an 11-item scale composed of three factors (L2 WTC inside the classroom, L2 WTC outside the classroom, and L2 WTC in the context of informal digital learning of English [IDLE]), with strong reliability and validity evidences. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was subsequently administered for a new sample (215 Indonesian EFL students), confirming the three-factor model that emerged from EFA. These results not only validate the existing L2 WTC scale but also expand its scale into digital settings, which will enable future research to consider another domain of L2 WTC (the IDLE context).

These analyses have many similarities, but they differ in their predictions for second language (L2) speakers. In an Anti-locality analysis, we expect L2 speakers to show a pattern very similar to first language (L1) speakers, with substantial degradation in acceptability for extraction of a subject from an embedded clause with that. In the Principle of End Weight analysis, we expect L2 speakers to display this same subject extraction degradation whether or not the embedded clause has that. A sentence acceptability experiment with L1 English speakers and two groups of L2 English speakers (L1 Korean and L1 Spanish) confirm the prediction of the Principle of End Weight analysis: the L1 speakers show degradation with subject extraction from a that-clause, while the L2 speakers do the same with clauses with and without that. These results form an interesting contrast with studies of island effects, which have generally found substantial L1 similar to L2 similarities, and show how L2 data can be used as evidence to decide between competing analyses of L1 phenomena.",2022

Based on a systemic functional approach to multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) and principles of sociosemiotic ethnography, it examines both the student's composing processes and his composed texts. In the writing center of an inclusive sixth-grade classroom in a U.S. elementary school, the student created multimodal PowerPoint slides explaining the greenhouse effect, and Glogster-based multimedia texts arguing for banning guns. The collected data include the student's texts, interview responses, and observation notes. Grounded in SF-MDA, the analytical framework draws on codes such as employed modes, modal resources, intermodal relations, and constructed meanings (i.e., ideational, interpersonal, and textual). The findings suggest that a) the student employed linguistic and visual modes in the mediums drawing on concurrence and complementarity intermodal relations; b) the student used non-linguistic resources for the ideational meanings of texts as a primary semiotic mode; and c) the student developed awareness of intermodal relations and metafunctions of sign systems in a non-linear way.

Drawing on notions of international posture (Yashima 2002), Ideal L2 Self (Dornyei 2009), and imagined communities (Norton 2001), we theorised imagination from a psychological perspective and a sociocultural lens. Then we conducted a mixed-method investigation to examine the complex relationship between imagination and informal digital learning of English (IDLE). A total of 401 participants from a tier-one university in China answered the survey, and 15 participated in post-survey interviews. Quantitative data revealed that students' international posture could positively influence their IDLE practices. The Ideal L2 Self could both contribute to IDLE and partially mediate the relationship between international posture and IDLE. Adding nuances to quantitative results, the analysis of the interview data highlighted three major themes--imagining possible selves, negotiating access, and investing in IDLE. These themes helped to make sense of the intricate ways in which EFL learners invest in IDLE trajectories by utilising the power of imagination to negotiate their desired memberships in imagined international communities.

This kind of engagement with texts calls upon readers to focus on form-meaning connections, and shifts the focus of reading purposes, toward reading as a form of participation in everyday literacy practices, and reading as a way of thinking critically about representation and communication. This article presents findings from an empirical study investigating the reading processes of second language (L2) French learners while interpreting an authentic multimodal web text, guided by tasks informed by multiliteracies. A prompted think-aloud methodology was used to capture learners' dynamic meaning-making processes. Drawn from a larger group of participants (n = 9), the current article reports on three unique cases, documenting their engagement with different semiotic modes and their evolving interpretations. The participants performed three phases of reading tasks: skimming for predictions about topic and authorship, scanning for specific details, and tracking webs of text signals. Participants saw the question prompts prior to each task phase, and again at the end of the phase, with multiple choice response options. Findings demonstrate participants' unique sets of interpretations and processes in terms of the way they drew differently upon various domains of background knowledge, genre knowledge, and reading strategies; the way they attended to various linguistic and non-linguistic modes; and the way the tasks guided their reading. The article concludes by suggesting several concrete instructional practices for L2 literacy development, including tasks that are adaptable for a range of languages.",2022

We studied 71 children who had received 50/50 bilingual instruction in German and English (so-called partial CLIL programs) as well as 105 children in minimal CLIL programs with almost uniquely monolingual German instruction (90% German, 10% English). In the data analysis, (1) generalized additive mixed modeling (GAMM) was combined with (2) mixed-effects regression modeling. The findings show that AO may exert an effect on L2 performance in bilingual but not traditional instructional settings. Furthermore, contact with English outside school is a strong predictor for learner outcome, regardless of the intensity of instruction and an early or late start respectively. We conclude that the traditional view of the age factor in instructional settings needs to give way to a new understanding of L2 development in intensive exposure conditions, in which age of acquisition is seen as a major determinant.",2022

In this study, we aimed to investigate L2 teachers' collaborative reflections on the current gaps in their classroom coursebook that could be bridged by the purposeful use of digital tools and address their attitudes towards their changing roles as digital materials developers. The findings demonstrated that, in their critical reflections, from a pedagogical perspective, the teachers pinpointed the dominance of passive language usage, the absence of personalized strategy-based instruction, and the lack of interactive content in the coursebook. From a task design perspective, they referred to the dominance of edutainment-free tasks, the prevalence of artificial peer tasks, the lack of multimodal scenario-based tasks, and the absence of adaptive feedback. The teachers further highlighted their shifting roles. As digital materials developers, they could create digital content for the digital natives, make digital mini-lessons for classrooms, attend project-based training courses, and co-produce digital content and tasks with students' assistance. As digital teacherpreneurs, they could run private social media-based businesses, join Edu-Tech co-working spaces, and produce digital artifacts in edutainment centers.

Hence, the current study examined vocabulary-related (word level, exposure frequency, salience) and learner-related (language proficiency, interest, viewing captions) variables and investigated factors affecting EFL students' incidental vocabulary learning in the use of a vernacular (noneducational) murder mystery game (N = 59). The study employed a quantitative research method and descriptive and inferential statistics (repeated measures ANOVA and multiple linear regression). The results showed that playing the game greatly facilitated L2 vocabulary acquisition and retention. Among the vocabulary-related variables, the study found that only salience significantly influenced vocabulary acquisition. Regarding the learner-related variables, the students' interest and viewing captions were positively related to vocabulary learning, whereas their language proficiency levels were negatively correlated. The study found that the students' conscious attention, in conjunction with salience of the word, was the main facilitating factor in incidental vocabulary acquisition and retention in the game-enhanced language learning environment. The study suggested pedagogical implications for incidental vocabulary learning through game play based on the results of the study.",2023

Data were gathered from class observations, interviews, and student artifacts. The collected data were analyzed based on inductive and deductive approaches as well as adaptive transfer. This study demonstrated that adolescent L2 learners applied the prior knowledge learned in narrative writing to argumentative writing, both within and beyond the current program. Another finding in this study is that the participants' knowledge acquired from digital multimodal composition influenced their print-based writing, and vice versa. The current study's demonstration of the transfer across genres and media confirms the existence of adaptive transfer which supports the reshaping of prior knowledge from familiar to unfamiliar contexts.

The goals of the study are to analyze the effects of social reading on learners' understanding of Chinese literary texts and investigate how an L2 teacher might effectively incorporate this activity in his/her classroom. The results indicate that students predominantly used the social reading experience to query fellow students about the meaning of vocabulary/Chinese characters in the digital, literary texts used in the study. eComma allowed students to co-construct meaning and scaffold their learning while engaged in close readings of the Chinese literary texts outside of the physical classroom. Drawbacks of social reading in this environment include students' frustrations with some technical aspects of the eComma tool and the instructor's concerns about meaningfully bridging students' social reading experiences outside of the class with in-class discussions/activities. Pedagogical suggestions regarding L2 open/social reading include adding timing constraints to promote more virtual interaction, better integrating students' virtual comments into classroom discussion/activities, and offering more structure for novice learners.

Although a deeper understanding of gaming ecology on game-based L2 use and learning is necessary to inform the selection and adaptation of digital games for L2 learning and teaching, to date the ecology of digital game-based learning remains underexplored. To address this gap, the present exploratory case study investigated the effect of learners' L2 proficiency, L2 learner identity, and gaming experience on the use of L2 in-game discourse of six learners of Arabic when playing the simulation-management video game Baalty. Informed by ecological approaches to L2 learning, data collected through questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, observations, walk-throughs, gaming journals, and interviews were analyzed and triangulated. Data analysis revealed that player-game interaction was deeply embedded in the gaming ecology and that learners' L2 proficiency, L2-learner identities, and gaming experience shaped the L2 learning potential of digital gaming.

Our study examined extramural vocabulary acquisition of 10th-grade L1 speakers of noncognate languages over one school year and explored the effects of digital activities and initial lexical knowledge of the participants on their vocabulary gains. Learners reported the amount of digital activity, took a vocabulary pretest, and kept vocabulary diaries where they recorded, on a weekly basis, the new words they encountered. At the end of the study, each student took a personalized test that included all the words recorded in their personal diary. The results indicate that (a) all learners gained some out-of-school word knowledge, (b) students with better initial vocabulary knowledge gained more words, and (c) the initial knowledge contributed to out-of-school learning more than the amount of digital activity. image",2023

In a previous investigation (Pusey & Butler, in press), we found that international graduate students' writing performance was different on assessment tasks that varied in terms of access to external writing resources (e.g., spell-check, dictionaries, internet content searches). To better understand the mechanisms underlying these different outcomes, participants' (n = 20) perceptions of the two task conditions (with or without access to external resources) were examined based on a questionnaire. Results indicated that participants tended to perceive writing tasks that permit access to external resources as more similar to university writing and as better vehicles for demonstrating their academic writing ability. However, they also perceived this task condition as more difficult than the one which disallowed use of external resources. Regarding enjoyment, test-takers' perceptions were almost evenly divided. Moreover, additional construct-irrelevant factors (e.g., topic, time, task characteristics and processes) appeared to influence perceptions of the tasks. The findings demonstrate the value of listening to test-taker voices to identify construct-irrelevant factors in writing assessments within the context of an increasingly digitalized world.",2024

Follow-up interviews (n = 20) were also conducted to identify factors that might have influenced their L2 WTC. Results showed that Korean and Taiwanese participants scored lowest on L2 WTC inside the classroom. The qualitative data suggest that L2 speaking anxiety might have equally influenced both groups' L2 WTC. Additionally, while Korean students scored higher on L2 WTC outside the classroom than Taiwanese students, the Taiwanese scored higher on L2 WTC in digital settings than did the Koreans. The qualitative data revealed that these discrepancies might have been influenced by English environment and teaching practice. These findings suggest that East Asian learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) can become more willing to communicate when sufficient opportunities for English use are provided through instructional and institutional support.",2022

Drawing on the concepts of transmediation and interpretant in social semiotic theories, this study explores the potential of digital storytelling (DST) in promoting EFL learners' willingness to communicate (WTC) through transmediation. A DST workshop was offered to 69 undergraduate students in China, and the workshop was intentionally designed to consist of prescript writing, video making, and postscript writing, which induced transmediation. Data sources included DST videos produced by the participating students, their prescripts and postscripts, and interviews, with a micro-level analysis conducted on two focal students. The results showed that the participants' L2 WTC significantly increased in the writing of the postscripts than the prescripts. Three interpretants generated through transmediation were identified to be associated with students' increased L2 WTC: expanded retrospective narratives, deepened perception, and evoked sentiments. Based on these findings, pedagogical implications for implementing DST projects as a fine example of multimodal composing practices in promoting EFL learners' L2 WTC and multimodal communicative competence are provided.",2022
53,WEB-BASED COLLABORATIVE WRITING IN L2 CONTEXTS: METHODOLOGICAL INSIGHTS FROM TEXT MINING,Collaborative Learning; Writing; Digital Literacies; Research Methods,2.0 TECHNOLOGIES; LANGUAGE; STUDENTS; WIKIS; FACILITATE; LEARNERS,"The increasingly widespread use of social software (e.g., Wikis, Google Docs) in second language (L2) settings has brought a renewed attention to collaborative writing. Although the current methodological approaches to examining collaborative writing are valuable to understand L2 students' interactional patterns or perceived experiences, they can be insufficient to capture the quantity and quality of writing in networked online environments. Recently, the evolution of techniques for analyzing big data has transformed many areas of life, from information search to marketing. However, the use of data and text mining for understanding writing processes in language learning contexts is largely underexplored. In this article, we synthesize the current methodological approaches to researching collaborative writing and discuss how new text mining tools can enhance research capacity. These advanced methods can help researchers to elucidate collaboration processes by analyzing user behaviors (e. g., amount of editing, participation equality) and their link to writing outcomes across large numbers of exemplars. We introduce key research examples to illustrate this potential and discuss the implications of integrating the tools for L2 collaborative writing research and pedagogy.",2017
54,The role of digital literacy in student engagement with automated writing evaluation (AWE) feedback on second language writing,Digital literacy; student engagement; AWE feedback; second language writing,WRITTEN-CORRECTIVE-FEEDBACK; ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LEARNERS; IMPACT,"Research on second language (L2) writing suggests that student engagement with automated writing evaluation (AWE) feedback is influenced by various individual and contextual factors. Little attention, however, has been given to the role that students' digital literacy can play in this process. Increasingly, digital literacy is becoming indispensable in language teaching and learning as reading, writing, and communicating are conducted and mediated by digital technologies. This study explores how seven L2 students engaged with AWE feedback on their L2 writing in a Chinese university, analysing data collected from student written texts, AWE feedback, and student interviews. We found that the students engaged with AWE feedback in different ways in terms of their perceptions, attitudes, and revisions. The study shows that students' digital literacy has considerable impact on how they engaged with AWE feedback regardless of their L2 proficiency. We argue that L2 students' digital literacy, characterised by an awareness of the affordances and constraints of technologies, an ability to evaluate digital information, and a willingness to use digital technologies for peer collaboration, can be a key factor in effective student engagement with AWE feedback on L2 writing.",2023

Theoretically, DLL provides a forum for understanding differences between child language and adult L2 learning, and the effects of learning context and learner characteristics. Practically, findings from learner behaviors, cognitive and affective processing, and brain correlates can inform DLL-based language pedagogies. Because of its highly interdisciplinary nature, DLL can serve as an approach to integrate cognitive, social, affective, and neural dimensions of L2 learning with new and emerging technologies including VR, AI, and big data analytics.",2022
56,Fostering EFL Learners' Digital Empathy through Multimodal Composing,Digital empathy; digital multimodal composing; video production; new literacy; English learning,ENGLISH; LITERACY,"The emergent cyber-violence along with the omnipresence of digital media has made the development of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' digital empathy a shared concern among contemporary language educators. Yet how this could be done in EFL/ second language (L2) pedagogies remains underexplored. Informed by a conceptualization of digital empathy as 'cognitive and emotional ability to be reflective and socially responsible while strategically using digital media', this study reports on a study that explores whether and how digital empathy can be fostered through a pedagogic innovation that engages students with digital multimodal composing (DMC) of videos in their conventional English curriculum. Aligning with a DMC approach to literacy through which learners were encouraged to construct meanings by drawing on multiple modes from their everyday media experiences, this study took place in a secondary English classroom at a vocational school in China. Data from interviews, observations and student-authored videos and documents showed that the DMC process enhanced students' awareness of having more empathy when engaging with online activities. The findings also show that with such enhanced awareness, students learned to use digital technologies for resolving important social issues and then became more active and responsible participants online. Implications about using DMC as an approach to develop students' digital empathy in the mainstream English curriculum are also discussed.",2020

Data were collected from 221 Korean as a Foreign Language (KFL) students (21 nationalities; mean age = 21.8 years). The quantitative analysis revealed that students who engaged in more receptive IDL-K than others reported greater L2 WTC in class, which yielded greater L2 WTC outside of class. However, students who engaged in more productive IDL-K than others reported greater L2 WTC only outside of class. The qualitative findings detailed how IDL-K benefited one KFL student by improving his vocabulary and topic knowledge (receptive) and increasing his interaction with Korean speakers (productive), both of which enhanced his L2 WTC. This is the first study to show how IDL-K affects L2 WTC both in and out of class and to provide new research agendas and innovative pedagogical insights in languages other than English.",2023

We illustrate six research themes for future research inquiry by pointing out the research gap, following a brief review of theoretical frameworks and existing empirical efforts on CW. We then expound on six specific research tasks that we deem to be pressing for this domain to progress, including more attention to multimodal CW, expanded frameworks for analyzing peer interaction and writing products, deployment of underused research techniques and improved research practice, development of CW assessment practice, as well as the inquiry of practitioners' input on CW. We hope to provide guidance for future research endeavors by identifying avenues of investigations on CW and meanwhile contribute to the trajectory of vibrant research on L2 writing and language learning.",2023

Games are said, amongst others, to be motivating, to lower affective barriers in learning, and to encourage foreign or second language (L2) interaction. But how do learners actually experience the use of games? What impact does gameplay have on students' perceptions of themselves as learners, and how does this affect their learning practice? These questions are important as they are likely to influence the success of digital game-based language learning, and as a result the way teachers might integrate games into the curriculum. In this study we investigated the experiences of five students who had participated in a fifteen-week game-based learning program at a university in Thailand. We conducted six interviews with each of them (for a total of 30 interviews) to identify what impact gameplay had in particular on their willingness to communicate in English (MacIntyre, Dornyei, Clement & Noels, 1998). The results showed that gameplay had a number of benefits for the participants in this study, in particular in terms of lowering their affective barriers to learning and increasing their willingness to communicate. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of further research and classroom practice.",2015

By combining Snapchat and StoryMap in the second language (L2) literature classroom, students adapt L2 language skills to twenty-first-century modes of communication, collaborate with peers, and creatively cross-disciplinary boundaries. Essential to this approach is the consideration of Snapchat (and image-based social media apps) as a twenty-first century literary genre (Bender 2020), and of mobile apps as interdisciplinary research objects (Morris and Murray 2018). From this point of departure, this essay offers a case study of a medium-inflected DHL2 approach (Cro 2020) to a Spanish literature seminar. It demonstrates how non-traditional, DH-inflected assignments increase student engagement with literature by fostering creativity and productive language play in communicative and analytic contexts. At the curricular level, literature professors' essential role in second-language acquisition becomes visible and active, as DH tools bridge the language/literature split (Bernhardt 2001) in L2 pedagogy and curriculum design in higher education. A creative DHL2 approach that adopts an alternative view of traditional L2 literature content to generate non-traditional assessments will improve L2 literature pedagogy and make literary content relevant to students' personal and professional experiences",2021

More specifically, it focuses on the practice of L2 academic writing as novice writers compose a source-based research paper in an English for Academic Purposes bridging program. The study followed seven student participants over several weeks as they worked on this assignment. Data-collection instruments included ongoing interviews throughout the writing process, document analysis of written drafts, screencast recordings, and researcher diary. Rhizoanalysis was used to analyze the data and map connections between the elements operating in the student writers' assemblage. Vignettes are presented to problematize conventional reading of data and to turn attention to texts in L2 writing research as asignifying machines. Reading participant data differently allows for exploration of the interconnections between the material, affective, and expressive elements and forces in the digital mediated source-based writing process. For these novice L2 student writers, the elements and forces in their assemblage operate in unique and unpredictable ways, producing unforeseen outcomes.",2021

Although affective mediators (e.g. enjoyment and anxiety) have been found to influence the relationship between IDLE and L2 WTC, it is unclear whether cognitive factors influence IDLE's effects on L2 WTC. This study aims to fill this gap by determining whether self-efficacy beliefs mediate the relationship between IDLE and L2 WTC among 246 Kazakhstani university EFL students. In contrast to previous research in other Asian contexts, our structural equation modelling results revealed that IDLE was not directly related to L2 WTC. Instead, self-efficacy beliefs acted as a full mediator between IDLE constructs and L2 WTC. These findings suggest that EFL students who participate in IDLE activities more frequently have a stronger belief in their own ability to perform various tasks in English, which leads to a greater willingness to communicate. This is the first research of its kind in Kazakhstani EFL context. This is also the first study to show that IDLE and L2 WTC are linked via a cognitive factor. Our research offers a context-specific pedagogical IDLE model to teachers and teacher educators in Kazakhstan and other similar EFL contexts.",2023

This article examines the perspectives of 185 undergraduate students enrolled in a fourth -semester French multiliteracies course at a university in the Southwestern United States. Through the theory and pedagogy of multiliteracies, this design-based implementation research investigates how students traversed multimodal composing in 376 video reflections and 265 digital multimodal projects. These data, along with interviews from 10 focal students, are analyzed qualitatively through multimodal transcription, open, axial, and selective coding to illuminate student perceptions. Findings demonstrate how the multimodal projects and the multiliteracies curricula provided students an avenue to develop critical literacy, a growth mindset, and a sense of community. Analysis additionally revealed that students perceived spontaneous speaking and time constraints as tensions in the multiliteracies curriculum. These findings hold implications for designing and scaffolding L2 multiliteracies courses throughout the scope and sequence of university language courses.",2023

Drawing on a quantitative research design and a sample of 261 Taiwanese EFL undergraduate students, two major findings were identified. First, students with higher levels of grit and L2 confidence had higher L2 WTC in all three communicative settings. It suggests that 1) if EFL students remain steadfast and persistent in learning and using English despite setbacks, and 2) if they are confident about communicating in English, they tend to initiate English communication in both digital and offline settings. Second, lack of L2 anxiety was a significant predictor of students' L2 WTC in non-digital environments (in-class and out-of-class contexts), but not in the digital setting. This suggests that contemporary EFL students may feel more comfortable with digital methods of communicating than conventional offline approaches, whether they use L1 or L2. The study also implies that digital environments may provide social support and additional psychological benefits, which potentially contribute to creating less L2 anxiety-provoking environment for EFL students. Drawn from these findings, pedagogical implications for ELT are also provided. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2019

The boundaries between concepts such as authorship and ownership have become blurred. This paper will deal with using digital texts in teaching reading comprehension on a university-level course with a special focus on Finnish as a second language. Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of teaching L2 reading comprehension in a multimodal learning environment will be discussed. The three main perspectives utilized are meaningfulness, sharing, and adaptivity. The students attending the course described in the paper were advanced university students from various European countries, who studied Finnish as a second language. The study examines the literacy practices that take place when learners of Finnish as a second language engage in reading and writing blogs in a reading comprehension course. The results of this study indicate that sharing, meaningfulness and adaptivity promote learners' engagement with reading as a social practice and thus support the claim that using blogs represents opportunities to enhance L2 reading comprehension skills.",2013

However, researchers have yet to investigate how L2 learners make meaning through embodied modes-or gestures and facial expressions. Grounded in the social semiotic theory of multimodality, this study leverages multimodal transcription and discourse analysis to describe how 126 college learners of L2 French used embodied modes in their video reflections. Findings reveal how gestures and facial expressions served to augment students' metalinguistic awareness and organizational capacities in French. Further, embodied modes supported students in connecting to their audience. Because online language learning has increased during pandemic times, the findings shed light on the important role of embodied modes in designing L2 video assignments.",2023

This unprecedented educational situation prompted teachers to exert more teacher agency on classroom teaching, leading to more discussion on the ecology of L2 teaching in an exploratory online environment. To know more about the relationships between digital affordances and teacher agency during the pandemic, the present study tracked two teachers' reflection on their Chinese language instruction over the 2020 spring semester to investigate how they utilized the special affordances via their teacher agency in L2 remote teaching. Reflective interviews showed their implementation of teacher agency through the use of technologies in relation to their teaching beliefs and social contexts. Framing digital affordances and teacher agency in an ecological view strengthened the links between classroom dynamics and social environment, which also implied adaptable instructional practices and resilient professional trends for future L2 online education.",2022

While considerable work has gone into developing and evaluating pedagogies for digital multimodal composing, one underresearched area is that of assessment. Given that the primary goal of digital multimodal composing is to develop competencies in multiple modes (including language) the question here is how to reflect this goal in the design of appropriate assessment criteria. In particular, teachers and researchers need to establish what dimensions of multimodal communicative competence to assess and how. In this paper, we present a case study of a university English for science course in which one of the assignments is a digital video scientific documentary. The study draws on interviews with teachers in order to determine how they conceive of the multimodal assessment task, including practical issues as well as challenges faced. The article proposes a process-based model for the assessment of digital multimodal composing, which shows how processes of instruction, design activity and assessment interact. Assessment can be planned at different stages of the design activity, draw on formative and summative strategies, and must take into account the orchestration of multimodal affordances.",2020
69,Using collocation clusters to detect and correct English L2 learners' collocation errors,Collocation cluster; collocation error detection; collocation error correction; digital reference tool,DRIVEN; WEB,"In this article, we describe an online English collocation explorer developed to help English L2 learners produce correct and appropriate collocations. Our tool, which is able to visually represent relevant correct/incorrect collocations on a single webpage, was designed based on the notions of collocation clusters and intercollocability proposed by Cowie and Howarth. As they pointed out, in a collocation cluster L2 learners generally cannot distinguish true collocations (e.g., tell truth, state truth, and state fact) from impossible combinations (e.g., *say fact and *say truth). Accordingly, our tool applies natural language processing techniques to construct collocation clusters to enable learners to easily differentiate between correct and incorrect pairs. Relying on data from a reference corpus, our system instantaneously processes the collocability of users' target combination (verb-noun or adj-noun) and all other relevant words and presents true/false collocations that L2 learners should master/avoid. To assess our tool, we investigated its performance in detecting and correcting learners' V-N and A-N errors, with results comparable to those of most previous studies. Piloted using a sample of 13 intermediate- or upper-intermediate level English as a foreign language learners, our tool was found to help them self-correct their collocation errors effectively. Compared with similar tools or approaches, our tool requires much less data resources, but still demonstrates a remarkable capability to detect/correct errors and generate useful collocational knowledge in English.",2021

In an effort to appeal to twenty-first-century students in rural Kansas, I designed my seminar to explore traditional questions of authorship, translation and reading, metafiction, self-invention, and parody, but through the lens of contemporary pop culture, including the graphic novel and mobile applications (apps). Unlike a traditional research paper, this course's non-traditional final assessment required students to place academic scholarship in an alternative, accessible format. It also promoted innovative, analytic interpretations of the novel through the juxtaposition of text, images, video, and sound in a medium in which students already excelled: Snapchat. In what follows, I describe this alternative Snapchat project and its pedagogical justifications, then reflect on the results, student feedback, successes, and limitations. Ultimately, I propose rethinking or reimagining the traditional Don Quijote seminar-and second-language (L2) literature courses and assessments more broadly-by embracing purportedly non-academic technologies like Snapchat, whose reliance on a variety of semiotic tools has the potential to teach traditional skills of literary analysis and increase students' engagement with and understanding of narrative processes.",2020

Drawing on student-authored videos from a digital multimodal composing (DMC) programme in China, this study reports on students' manifestation of CP during DMC. Data from student-authored videos, classroom observation, and interviews reveal that the students used DMC for three forms of CP, including advocacy of the sexually discriminated, fundraising efforts for the left-behind children stricken by poverty, and promoting civic learning of disease-related knowledge and protection measures. The findings also reveal that these forms of CP were manifested by the students' creative remixing of videos and visuals and ingenious layering of student-generated narrations based on their authentic concerns and community experiences. Implications on how DMC can be used to facilitate students' CP in language curricula are discussed.",2022

The study assumed that goal-directed player activity in this environment would configure digital narratives, which in turn would help study participants in the experimental group to co-configure story maps for ordering and making sense of the problem spaces encountered in the environment. The study further assumed that these participants would subsequently rely on the story maps to help them structure written L2 narratives describing an imagined personal experience closely resembling the gameplay of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study found that immersion in the 3D-DGBLL environment influenced the manner in which the second language was invoked in these written narratives: Participants in the experimental group produced narratives containing more textual indicators describing the activity associated with the recycling and waste management systems and the spaces in which these systems are located. Increased usage of these indicators suggest that participants in the experimental group did indeed rely on story maps generated during 3D gameplay to structure their narratives, although stylistic and grammatical features of the narratives suggest, however, that changes could be made to the curricular implementation of the 3D-DGBLL environment. The study also puts forward ideas for instructional best practices based on research findings and suggests future areas of development and investigation.",2015

Though there is an emerging presence of Chinese online games, many more young people are playing the English- or Japanese-language versions of the most popular commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games. In other words, most Chinese gamers are playing L2 digital games in their leisure time. Informed by research on out-of-class L2 learning, this paper discusses findings from an exploratory study investigating L2 gaming and learning practices in young people's everyday lives. Drawing on rich data from gaming sessions, stimulated recall, focus group discussion, individual interviews and online discussion forums, this paper argues that gamers exercise autonomy by managing their gameplay both as leisure and learning practices in different dimensions (location, formality, locus of control, pedagogy and trajectory). At the same time, gameplay-as-learning practices are supported by wider communities of digital gamers who take on roles as language teachers and advisers. The paper suggests that activities in these dimensions mediated learning autonomously and from community, and discusses the research and pedagogical implications for L2 gaming and learning.",2014

The process is inspired by the autobiographical model proposed by Story Center (storycenter.org) with some adaptations to the Spanish as a second language (L2) context. The topic of the project focuses on intercultural and/or target language learning discovery narratives. This study collects data through two questionnaires completed by 162, 98 and 46 volunteer participants (before the project, after and in both cases). Although motivation was the main initial emotion, inexperience with video editing tools generated an attitude of stress in some students that interfered with perception of an opportunity for learning. This result matches a significantly higher time spent in editing than in writing, the essential task of the digital storytelling process. Findings showed a more positive final perception. Different learnings are analyzed in relation to (a) linguistic-communicative, both in oral and written expression, (b) social and (c) biografical and identity sense-making aspects.",2022

We collected survey data from 308 EFL Hong Kong secondary students who lacked any international experience (ages 12-18). After controlling for demographic data, the results show that teacher appreciation, personal enjoyment, and social enjoyment all mediate the relationship between IDLE and L2 WTC inside the classroom, while personal and social enjoyment mediate the link outside the classroom. A closer look reveals that personal enjoyment, rather than social enjoyment or teacher appreciation, plays a larger role in mediating the relationship. Practically, these findings shed light on the underlying mechanisms by which IDLE and different aspects of FLE can potentially improve the L2 WTC of Asian EFL learners who primarily learn and practice English in the classroom. These findings have implications for future interventions aimed at enhancing L2 WTC by increasing L2 enjoyment in EFL learners.",2022

Even less is known about the effects of DMC on students' L2 writing development. This study aims to address this issue by investigating whether and to what extent DMC would influence Chinese EFL learners' L2 writing performance. To this end, DMC was implemented as a pedagogical intervention in an EFL course offered at a Chinese university. The experimental group (n = 66) was required to complete three multimodal projects and the control group (n = 30) was asked to write on the same topics but without completing any multimodal project. All the participants completed two writing tasks before and after the intervention (a pretest-posttest design). The results of the study showed that as compared with the control group, the experimental group displayed significant improvements in five aspects of L2 writing (i.e., text length, mean length per T-unit, task requirement, content, and comprehensibility). Implications for integrating DMC into L2 writing teaching were considered. Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/09588221.2021.1945635 .",2023

All participants read the same articles, with discussions guided by the same reading questions. Participants' dialogs in both conditions were coded based on types of discursive moves, then analyzed through a framework of social, textual, and linguistic affordances. Findings revealed that social affordances emerged significantly more frequently than other affordances among FTF groups while textual affordances emerged significantly more frequently than other affordances among DSAR groups. Findings support the benefits of DSAR tools for more anchored discussions over traditional FTF classroom discussions, with the caution that DSAR tools alone do not necessarily promote deep discussion of foreign language texts. Beyond pedagogical implications, this study suggests an expansion of theoretical frameworks of affordances in future DSAR research.",2023
78,Perceived changes of identity construction through digital storytelling: A collective study abroad case study,Study Abroad; Digital Stories; Identity; Activity Theory; Foreign Language,,"Study abroad (SA) is considered one of the best ways to learn a foreign (FL) or second language (L2) while developing open-mindedness and intercultural awareness (Williams, 2009). Yet, less attention has been placed on students' perception on identity development. Thus, the current study focuses on how the outcome (identity awareness in a SA setting) is achieved through the relationship between subject (students), instruments (tools and artifacts), community and rules (classroom and SA experience), division of labor (peer feedback) in relation to the object (Digital story). The study includes six SA students' perceptions on identity construction through the incorporation of multiliteracies and multimodal texts (digital stories) in a second-year foundational Spanish course and an Advanced Spanish Grammar course in a Study Abroad (SA) program. Analyses of questionnaires, and DSs were grounded in Rogers' (1959) notion of self-concept and Activity Theory (Leontiev, 1978). Results suggest that the digital and multimodal nature of DS creation facilitated greater opportunities for students to document their self-perceived gains in terms of identity awareness.",2022
79,Developing and evaluating a set of process and product-oriented classroom assessment rubrics for assessing digital multimodal collaborative writing in L2 classes,Digital multimodal composing; Assessment rubric; Collaborative writing; Product-oriented assessment; Process-oriented assessment,,"Despite the growing interest in researching digital multimodal composing (DMC) in recent years, there were few attempts of tapping how assessments on DMC can best be devised to maximize students' learning opportunities. To narrow this gap, this study proposed a set of product-and process-oriented classroom assessment rubrics that function as self-and peer-assessment tools for students when collaborating with each other to create DMC in online EAP contexts. During a four-week intervention with a veteran EAP educator, the rubric was tried out in her EAP classes as students worked in pairs to complete a DMC task. Its effectiveness was then evaluated based on the quality of student writings as well as their discussion, which was measured in terms of equality and mutuality. The product-oriented assessment rubrics was found to result in marked improvement in layout, navigation and rhetoric, whilst the process-oriented classroom assess-ment rubrics also enhanced both the equality and the mutuality of the collaborative process, as the dyads were inclined to establish a collaborative relationship during the task. These findings underscore the importance of using assessment rubrics as a formative assessment activity to help students harness the genre of DMC from different perspectives.",2023
80,The Distributed L1 and L2 Language-Learning Environments of Dual Language Learners Across Home and School Settings,,PRESCHOOLERS ENGLISH VOCABULARY; LITERACY PRACTICES; HEAD-START; BILINGUAL PRESCHOOLERS; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; SPANISH; CHILDREN; EXPOSURE; INPUT; SPEAKING,"Purpose: This study explored the language-learning environments of typically developing dual language learners (DLLs) who learned Cantonese (first language [L1]) at home and English (second language [L2]) in preschool settings through direct and indirect measures. Method: Nine typically developing Cantonese-English DLLs participated in this study. Participants' daylong activities were audio-recorded using the digital language processor of the Language ENvironment Analysis system. A manual coding scheme was developed to examine the audio recordings with the focus of the amount of L1 and L2 used by participants, adults, and their peers across home and school settings. In addition, participants' language use was indirectly examined using parent questionnaires, teacher reports, and classroom observations. Results: The results of the audio recordings showed that Cantonese was the primary language used at home, and both Cantonese and English were used in school settings, consistent with the parent and teacher reports. Correlation analyses revealed that the amount of L1 used by the participants was associated with the L1 used by their peers: and the amount of L2 used by participants was positively related to the L2 used by adults at home. Conclusions: The findings illustrate how parent/teacher reports and daylong audio recordings could complement each other in the investigation of DLLs' language-learning environments.",2020

While the benefits of exposure to print have been well-established in previous studies, how online reading may impact individuals' literacy development is largely underexplored. The current study investigated if the amount of English reading experience on the Internet could predict EFL students' lexical knowledge and reading comprehension ability. Participants were ninety-seven Vietnamese undergraduate students who were administered a website checklist and a vocabulary size test. Their reading comprehension scores were also collected as measures of their reading abilities. Descriptive statistics, hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modelling were utilized for data analysis. The results indicated that exposure to L2 online text was a significant predictor of the participants' vocabulary size as well as their reading comprehension growth during a course of two years. Pedagogical implications are discussed.",2020
82,"Investigating linguistic, literary, and social affordances of L2 collaborative reading",Digital Literacies; Multiliteracies; Reading,ONLINE ANNOTATION; STUDENTS USE; SUPPORT; TOOLS,"This exploratory study analyzes learner-learner interactions within a virtual environment when collaboratively reading Spanish poetry in a Hispanic literature course at the college level via an ecological theoretical perspective (van Lier, 2004). The goals of the study are (a) to present empirical data that illustrate the theoretical construct of affordance in a virtual, collaborative reading environment, and (b) to investigate the pedagogical ramifications of using a digital annotation tool to involve learners in collaborative reading. Three distinct types of affordances emerged in the data: linguistic, literary, and social affordances. Our findings indicate that the number of literary and social affordances outnumbered the linguistic affordances that emerged in students' threaded discussions while collaboratively reading and annotating poems. In addition, the primary challenges for learners when engaging in collaborative reading included others' comments impeding some students' understanding of the text, and having to make one's comments distinct from others' comments to avoid being socially viewed as an inactive reader or student. From a pedagogical perspective, the primary benefits of incorporating collaborative reading in a second language poetry course involve the ability to establish a more open learning community and allowing students to carry out a closer reading of literary texts.",2017
83,Teacher engagement with digital multimodal composing in a Chinese tertiary EFL curriculum,digital multimodal composing; EFL curriculum; new literacy; second language teaching; teacher engagement,ENGLISH; COMMUNITIES; CHALLENGES; LITERACIES; PEDAGOGIES; CULTURE,"While previous studies have examined the impact of digital multimodal composing (DMC) as a new literacy activity on second language (L2) learners' language development, L2 teachers' engagement with DMC is under-conceptualized and underexplored. Based on a qualitative analysis of five teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL) who implemented in their curriculum a year-long DMC program within which students produced multimodal videos, this study presents three forms of teacher engagement with DMC. In the first form, the teachers used DMC as an instrument for traditional exercises of speaking and writing with incidental attention to the multimodal aspects of DMC, while in the second, the teachers manifested ambivalence about the means and the ends of using DMC. The teacher in the third form used DMC as integral to pedagogy with attention to not only students' language use, but also strategic use of multiple resources. These results suggest that teacher engagement with DMC can be conceptualized as a multifaceted continuum. The findings also reveal that these individualized engagements were directed by teachers' conceptions of themselves, students, and language and mediated by contextual factors associated with the prescribed curriculum and high-stakes testing regimes. The paper concludes with implications regarding ways to promote teacher engagement with DMC in digitalized instructional landscapes.",2021

Building on this work, one recent line of research has examined the extent to which SLA findings about crosslinguistic influence can be used to improve L2 learning, indicating that explicit instruction tailored to address the nature of the crosslinguistic learning problem can benefit L2 performance. At the same time, however, this line of inquiry is relatively novel and under-researched. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to suggest further research which might advance knowledge and understanding about the ways in which explicit instruction can facilitate second language (L2) learning of crosslinguistically difficult target features. To this end, I lay the ground for a series of close replications designed to understand the role of prior language knowledge and experience in L2 learning: Ellis and Sagarra (2011) and Tolentino and Tokowicz (2011). These studies were selected because they are grounded in empirical SLA research and SLA theory. In addition, the selected studies facilitate replication because they have either (i) made their data collection materials available in digital repositories or (ii) have robustly described their design and provided the stimuli used.",2022
85,Language-related computer use: Focus on young L2 English learners in Sweden*,ESL students; Computer-assisted language learning; self-report; computer games; English language learning; schoolchildren,PROFICIENCY; GAMES,"This paper presents findings from a study investigating young English language learners (YELLs) in Sweden in 4(th) grade (N = 76, aged 10-11). Data were collected with the help of a questionnaire and a one-week language diary. The main purpose was to examine the learners' L2 English language-related activities outside of school in general, and their use of computers and engagement in playing digital games in particular. A comparison is made between language-related activities in English, Swedish, and other languages. Another purpose was to see whether there is a relationship between playing digital games and (a) gender, (b) L1, (c) motivation for learning English, (d) self-assessed English ability, and (e) self-reported strategies for speaking English. In order to do so, the sample was divided into three digital game groups, (1) non-gamers, (2) moderate, and (3) frequent gamers (>= 4 hours/week), based on diary data (using self-reported times for playing digital games in English). Results showed that YELLs are extensively involved in extramural English (EE) activities (M = 7.2 hrs/w). There are statistically significant gender differences, boys (11.5 hrs/w) and girls (5.1 hrs/w; p < .01), the reason being boys' greater time investment in digital gaming and watching films. The girls, on the other hand, spent significantly more time on pastime language-related activities in Swedish (11.5 hrs/w) than the boys (8.0 hrs/w; p < .05), the reason being girls' greater time investment in facebooking. Investigation of the digital game groups revealed that group (1) was predominantly female, (2) a mix, and (3) predominantly male. YELLs with an L1 other than Swedish were overrepresented in group (3). Motivation and self-assessed English ability were high across all groups. Finally, regarding the self-reported strategies, code-switching to one's L1 was more commonly reported by non- and moderate gamers than frequent gamers.",2014

To fill these gaps, this study employed a six-week multiple-exposure design to investigate the extent which to textual enhancement can benefit children's knowledge of L2 derivational morphemes. The study employed a pretest-posttest design, with six treatment sessions. Participants were 91 L2 learners of English in two primary school EFL contexts (Romania, Sweden). In each context, participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the +highlight group received textually enhanced texts, whereas the -highlight group read unenhanced texts during the treatment. The children read the texts through a digital reader application during their English lessons. The target constructions were the -ion and -ment morphemes. The pretest and posttest included a non-word derivational suffix choice and a nonword derivational suffix decomposition task. Results of linear mixed effects models found a small advantage of textual enhancement for the acquisition of the -ion morpheme by Swedish learners on the suffix choice task, but Romanian learners showed no benefits from highlighting.",2021

Although scholars have made strong claims on the benefits of game-based learning, empirical findings have not yet established strong support for the effectiveness of games. Existing studies are mostly descriptive rather than experimental; few studies have compared L2 learning outcomes between a game-based learning group and a comparison control group. To fill this gap, this study investigated the instructional and motivational effects of a digital game on learning Chinese formulaic expressions. We developed two digital learning environments: a scenario-based digital game (Questaurant) and an interactive online lesson. Forty-nine learners of Chinese in two U.S. universities were randomly assigned to the game group (n = 25) or the online lesson group (n = 24). Both groups equally improved their knowledge of formulaic expressions after the respective learning session. However, the game group showed a significantly higher level of motivation compared to the online lesson group.",2021

This study analyzed references across eight degrees of accessibility, revealing that this did not account for infrequent pronoun use by Chinese learners of English. Further analysis revealed that participants were seldom overexplicit when referring to highly accessible individuals, particularly those that represented continued topics, but were significantly more likely than native speakers to use lexical noun phrases elsewhere, particularly for main characters. This is discussed in relation to a possible role of overexplicitness as a clarity-based communication strategy.",2015
89,Technology-enhanced socialisation into disciplinary writing in L2: insights from the perceptions of MA TEFL students,Academic writing; thesis writing; technology-enhanced language socialisation,,"In order to obtain qualifications to teach English as a foreign language (TEFL), teacher candidates often need to commit themselves to writing a master's (MA) thesis. In efforts to shed light on how MA thesis supervisors can support supervisees in the writing process, drawing on the theoretical framework of language socialisation, this article presents part of an ongoing action research study, exploring how MA TEFL students perceived technology-enhanced socialisation, i.e., developments in their competence, beliefs and practices, into disciplinary writing in English. Six first-year Polish MA TEFL students enrolled in MA thesis-oriented courses reflected on the process of becoming more competent MA thesis writers by answering online survey open-ended questions. The study reveals that thesis writing in L2 can be an overwhelming process, during which the students struggle emotionally, but which they are determined to complete. The results suggest that MA supervisors can support the socialisation of MA TEFL students - novice disciplinary L2 writers - by mindfully providing the students with guidance on and access to relevant and quality materials, by allowing for regular writing opportunities, as well as making space for supervisor-students and student-student interaction and feedback. As digital tools mediate the relationship between individual students and their social-material learning environment, technology is an important element of this environment and course design needs to include blended learning experiences to enhance the process of socialisation into disciplinary writing in L2.",2022

Attention in mainstream research of IDLE has been directed to (meta)cognition, learning outcomes, etc. as separate domains of IDLE; however, these significant efforts have neither clarified the blurry boundary between semi-structured IDLE practices and unstructured extramural practices nor investigated factors that positively predict learners' IDLE-enhanced learning outcomes or practices on the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. As such, the present study sets out to extend the discussion of informal digital learning of English (IDLE) by establishing a recontextualized model of IDLE. To this end, a total of 1080 Chinese university EFL learners were invited to complete an IDLE questionnaire survey developed and validated in the context of China. Using IBM SPSS Amos 22, structural equation modeling was run to examine the inter-factorial relationships among six IDLE sub-constructs by examining eight hypotheses. The results confirm that 1) learners' IDLE-enhanced benefits are positively predicted by support from their important others, resources and cognition, but not learners' authentic L2 experience and IDLE frequency and devices, and 2) learners' IDLE practices can be significantly predicted by resources and cognition, authentic L2 experience, and IDLE frequency and devices. Based on these findings, we put forward an expanded conceptual framework of IDLE and suggest more replication studies in the future to testify this study's generalizability and to arrive at more stable conclusions.",2022
91,Exploring the Effect of Corpus-Based Writing Instruction on Learner-Corpus Interaction in L2 Revision: A Study of Chinese EFL Disciplinary Writers,,STUDENTS; TECHNOLOGY; CORPORA,"The use of academic corpora in second language (L2) writing pedagogy has gained popularity in recent decades, particularly in genre-specific contexts for graduate-level L2 students (Charles, 2007; Lee & Swales, 2006). However, its overall effectiveness is mainly observed within classroom contexts, influenced by various contextual and participant-related factors (Vyatkina & Boulton, 2017). Moreover, these investigations have predominantly relied on retrospective data useful for understanding learners' perception of corpus-analysis experiences, but not for how learners strategically integrate corpora into personal toolkits for self-directed writing tasks. Addressing these gaps, this study tracks five Chinese EFL graduate students' corpus use through a 5-week concept- and corpus-based tutoring intervention and investigates how they navigated a discipline-specific corpus alongside other digital resources during post-intervention self-directed revisions. By triangulating screen recordings with retrospective data (questionnaires, interviews, draft revisions, and stimulated recalls), the results showed that while participants were generally favorable toward the specialized corpus and its complementary role to personal toolkits, individual problem-solving patterns in revision revealed less overall reliance on the corpus and its effectiveness primarily in addressing known linguistic problems. Implications for a relational understanding of digital tools support and the integration of other pedagogical activities in L2 writing instruction are discussed.",2024

Use of digital Pinyin input may facilitate connections between oral and written language by allowing learners to access vocabulary they cannot yet write. We assessed the effects of promoting digital Pinyin writing by engaging students in text messaging in digital chat rooms as part of the 4th grade Chinese language arts curriculum at an American Chinese immersion school. Students in two classes engaged in text messaging over eight weeks while a matched group of students in other classes taught by the same teachers (N = 28 per condition) completed their regular pencil-and-paper word work, which emphasized morphological and orthographic analysis of meaning- and sound-based radicals and sets of related characters. Post-intervention, children who engaged in text messaging showed lesser gains in Chinese writing as compared to the children who completed word work, though within texting groups children who did well at texting showed greater gains in writing as compared to children with lesser success at texting. Given the urgent need for effective online learning, the findings indicate that care should be taken when introducing digital Pinyin input into the Chinese language arts curriculum as it should supplement, but not replace, multi-component word work exercises that promote awareness of orthographic patterns, meaning, and Pinyin.",2022

Write Assistant is a newly developed tool aimed at assisting people writing in a second language. It feeds on big data taken in from corpora and digital dictionaries. The paper discusses the philosophy behind the tool, the techniques applied, its empirical basis and functionality, as well as the extent to which it helps its users. It shows how the tool makes it possible to shorten and even skip some phases in the traditional information-search process and allows its user to maintain the focus on the message to be written without the need to consult external information resources. The paper shows how the underpinning technology gives birth to a new type of dictionary that is context-aware and provides a more personalised user service. But it also indicates that future dictionaries need to be conceptionally adapted to the specific tool in order to optimize the service. All this poses new challenges to lexicography.",2017
94,Language Learners' Historical Bodies Directing their Agency in the Digital Wilds,Agency; digital wilds; discourse; historical body; language learning; nexus analysis,L2,"Life histories and prior experiences of language learning, called historical bodies, direct language learners' agency. However, their influence on agency is often underemphasized in the language-learning context. To develop practices that facilitate foreign language learners' agency beyond the classroom, I present the case of American university-level Finnish learners' reflections on their language use in the digital wilds, where they used different digital applications not designed for language learning. The data came from a portfolio assignment in which students documented and reflected on their independent language use. The study drew on nexus analysis, and discourse analysis was used to examine the reflections. The findings show that historical bodies directed what resources students used as learning material, what elements they oriented to as learning projects, and how they oriented themselves to future actions. Understanding the impact of historical bodies is important in shaping inclusive classroom practices that consider students' agency and individuality.",2024

This exploratory study is a first attempt to explore this issue, focusing on the ef-fects of working memory and language aptitude on the quality of paper versus computer-based L2 writing performance. Forty-two Spanish learners of L2 English performed a problem-solving task either digitally or on paper, took a working memory n-back test, and completed LLAMA tests to measure language aptitude. The quality of their L2 written texts was assessed in terms of complexity, accuracy and fluency (CAF) measures. The results indicated that the role of cognitive indi-vidual differences may vary depending on the writing environment.",2022

L2 learning engagement on an ab initio Irish language LMOOC",massive open online course (MOOC); language learning; computer-assisted language learning; psycholinguistics; educational psychology,MOTIVATION; LEARNERS; MOOCS,"Language massive open online courses (LMOOCs) represent an exciting prospect for language teachers and instructors around the globe (Barcena & Martin-Monje, 2014). In this paper, we report on the dynamics of participation and learner behaviour in an ab initio Irish language course. The course, Irish 101, ran during March 2019, and we used a mixed-methods approach to analyse both typical patterns of behaviour among course participants and learner reflections upon their reasons for doing so. Findings suggest that most learners use the course resources in an assessing and exploratory manner and are far less likely to produce, or to examine, second language (L2) output, either written or spoken. Learners were found to be selective and to demonstrate significant metacognitive awareness (Wenden, 1998) in their interactions and learning methods, displaying agency and exploiting affordances beyond the design of the course itself. Implications for LMOOC design, including the need to question whether courses should emphasise L2 production or resource provision, are considered, in addition to a general need for more granular, dynamic research, so as to better understand the types of learners who engage in LMOOCs and to better cater to diverse learning needs.",2021
97,The process of note-taking in consecutive interpreting A digital pen recording approach,note-taking; consecutive interpreting; process research; cognitive load; digital pen recording,ENGLISH,"This article reports the findings of an empirical study on the process of note-taking in consecutive interpreting (CI). The focus is on the data collected via digital pen recording and voice recording while professional interpreters performed CI between Chinese (L1) and English (L2). In both directions of interpreting, the study found that the interpreters preferred language to symbol and English to Chinese. It was also found that the physical and temporal demands of symbol and abbreviation notes were lower than those of language and full word notes, respectively, whereas the ear-pen span (EPS) of symbol notes was longer than that of language notes. As to the relationship between note-taking and interpreting performance, the data showed that a higher percentage of English notes was correlated with a worse performance in both directions of interpreting. There were also some differences between the directions: in E-C interpreting, the performance was better when the EPS was shorter, when the participants used more symbol notes, and when they used fewer language notes, but in C-E interpreting, the quality of performance was positively correlated with the quantity of notes.",2020

The task created for this study consisted of 12 low-frequency vocabulary terms nonnative speakers (NNS) were expected to negotiate with their native speaker (NS) counterparts in order to reach mutual understanding and to complete the task successfully. Six NS-NNS dyads (N = 12) carried out the task, each using both videoconferencing (Skype) and text-based real-time chat during the same session in a counterbalanced design. It was found that (a) if a task consists of multiple items to be exchanged, with multiple triggers of potential nonunderstanding, the NNS response gradually moves from task-appropriate response to face-appropriate response during the course of an ongoing task session; (b) in order to ensure successful task completion, the NS tends to respond to NNS face-appropriate behaviour with responses that are both face- and task-appropriate; and (c) NNS nonunderstanding of a particular target item shapes the expectations of both NS and NNS concerning the next task item.",2020

This paper reports the development and validation of a writing ePortfolio scoring rubric for an action research course for L2 learners. Using Bachman's (2005) 'Assessment Use Argument' as a basis, two main claims to support the validity of the rubric were examined: (1) the rubric is a reliable tool; and, (2) the rubric is relevant to the construct being measured. A mixed-method approach was used in the development and validation of the eight-criteria analytic and holistic evaluation scoring rubric. Thirteen raters evaluated thirty-eight ePortfolios in the study. The analyses of raters' ratings using a many-facet Rasch measurement approach and raters' individual standardised open-ended interviews indicated that overall the rubric's analytic categories functioned appropriately to assess the intended construct. However, the criterion 'Ease of Navigation' was found to be misfitting due to differences in raters' evaluation of the same ePortfolios. Overall, the argument-based validation indicated that the scoring rubric is a reliable and valid instrument for the purpose of assessing L2 writing ePortfolios in the context for which it was developed.

100,An EFL Teacher's Investment in Digital Multimodal Composing,,,"Although there is a growing call for L2 teachers to invest in using digital multimodal composing (DMC) as an instructional activity, there is a paucity of research on whether and how L2 teachers invest in DMC, and the impact of DMC on their teaching and changing identities remains underexplored. This study reports on a longitudinal case study of an EFL teacher's investment in DMC in a university-based EFL classroom in China. Aqualitative analysis of the data gathered from observation, interview, and informal conversation reveals that through investing in DMC this teacher started to renegotiate herself as a composing guide, a peer mentor, and a change agent. These shifts of identity were mainly driven by her enhanced cultural and social capital after investing in DMC, despite constraints from ideology and the policing of technology, language-dominant assessment, and other institutional demands. Implications on using DMC are also discussed.",2020

Our results showed that unfocused indirect CF (feedback on all error types through the provision of metalinguistic comments on the nature of the errors made) combined with extra computer-mediated micro-tasks was the most efficient CF type to foster writing accuracy development in our context. Following up on this study, this paper further explores the effects of this specific CF type on learners' written accuracy development in an online EFL course designed for freshmen STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) students. In the online course under study, this specific CF type was experimented with different cohorts of STEM learners (N = 1,150) over a five-year period (from 2014 to 2019) and was computer-assisted: CF provision online by a human tutor was combined with predetermined CF comments. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of this specific CF strategy on error types. In this respect, the data yield encouraging results in terms of writing accuracy development when learners benefit from this computer-assisted specific CF. This study thus helps to gain a better understanding of the role that CF plays in shaping students' revision processes and could inform language (teacher) education regarding the use of digital tools for the development of foreign language accuracy and the issues related to online CF provision.",2021
102,Marriages of convenience? Teachers and coursebooks in the digital age,,,"This article reports on a survey of Swedish EFL teachers' attitudes towards, and dependence on, ELT coursebook packages in the light of recent research into digital literacy. The results showed that while ICT is making massive inroads into language classrooms in technologically advantaged countries like Sweden, the coursebook package still has its place assured among trainee teachers, at least for the immediate future. The current generation of 'digital native' pre-service teachers still looks to coursebook packages to structure lessons during teaching practice and as a means of providing extended reading practice in the L2. Their more experienced in-service colleagues are, however, increasingly abandoning the coursebook in favour of freestanding digital resources. Practising teachers in the survey increasingly saw coursebooks in contingency terms and as a 'fall-back' position. Finally, the article considers the desirability of a more fundamental abandonment of the coursebook in favour of digital tools and resources in the EFL classroom.",2015

After an instructional period in which attention to literacy was embedded in their science classes, the learners designed and illustrated their own complex machine, filmed a digital video and produced a written explanation. By integrating a systemic functional linguistics-informed analysis of the linguistic features of the children's written texts with a semiotic analysis of the intermodal relationships in their projects, we offer insights into the interrelation of different modes (linguistic, visual and aural) in facilitating children's meaning-making in the L2. The results revealed considerable within-group variability in the learners' written texts and intermodal relations of concurrence and complementarity in their multimodal projects.

The ability to quantify language learners' proficiency in terms of prosody can be of use to language teachers and improve the assessment of L2 speaking skills. Automatic assessment, however, requires reliable automatic analyses of prosodic features that allow for the comparison between the productions of L2 speech and reference samples. In this paper we investigate whether signal-based syllable prominence can be used to predict the prosodic competence of Finnish learners of Swedish. Syllable-level prominence was estimated for 180 L2 and 45 native (L1) utterances by a continuous wavelet transform analysis using combinations of f(0), energy, and duration. The L2 utterances were graded by four expert assessors using the revised CEFR scale for prosodic features. Correlations of prominence estimates for L2 utterances with estimates for L1 utterances and linguistic stress patterns were used as a measure of prosodic proficiency of the L2 speakers. The results show that the level of agreement conceptualized in this way correlates significantly with the assessments of expert raters, providing strong support for the use of the wavelet-based prominence estimation techniques in computer-assisted assessment of L2 speaking skills.

105,Investigating the ecological validity of second language writing assessment tasks,L2 writing assessment; Digital tools; Ecological validity; English for academic purposes; Self-assessment,RESEARCHERS; PERFORMANCE; STUDENT,"Nowadays, writing in academic settings is mediated by digital technology in essential ways, yet many writing test tasks deny access to the digital resources common to everyday practice (e.g., spell-check, electronic dictionaries). This discrepancy potentially threatens the ecological validity of such tasks and raises questions about construct (under) representation. Informed by an ecological perspective on language and communication (van Lier, 2004), a study was carried out to better understand how access to writing resources impacts writing test task performance. Twenty-two international students enrolled in a graduate program in the United States completed two argumentative writing tasks. On one of the tasks, participants were given full access to writing resources; on the other task, no access to writing resources was given. Average scores on participants' essays were analyzed quantitatively to determine the degree to which, and in what specific domains, performance differed under each condition. In addition, participants' self assessments of performance on the tasks were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results suggest that writers benefitted from having access to writing resources, but the perceived impact of resource accessibility differed from the scores given by raters. These findings have implications for writing test task design and may help inform L2 writing instruction.",2023

One view, primarily based on data from L2 article production, suggests that grammatical patterns licensed by learners' native language (L1) and those licensed by their L2 compete for selection, leading to variability in the production of L2 functional morphology. In this study, we show that the idea of structural competition has broader applicability, in correctly predicting certain asymmetries in the production of both the definite article the and plural marking -s by Thai learners of English. At the same time, we recognize that learners' growing sensitivity to structural regularities in the L2 might be an additional contributing factor, and therefore make a novel proposal for how the L1-L2 structural competition model and the sensitivity-to-L2-structural regularities account could be integrated and their respective contributions studied under the constraint-satisfaction model of language processing. We argue that this approach is particularly suited to studying bilingual processing as it provides a natural framework for explaining how highly disparate factors, including partially activated options from both languages, interact during processing.",2015
107,Student engagement with digital video production,,ENGLISH,"In many contexts of contemporary ELT, the L2 can be widely encountered beyond the classroom. In these settings, teachers need to maximize opportunities for meaningful participation. Digital video production (DVP) provides one such opportunity. Little, however, is known about the types of DVP common in particular contexts of ELT, the extent to which DVP functions as a motivational resource, or how engagement is generated. This mixed-methods study in a Swedish context addresses these questions. Results show that DVP takes place in genre-specific forms and has significant motivational potential. Analyses suggest that DVP can generate embodied forms of engagement. By creating appealing characters and storylines, and through the use of mobile devices and easy-to-use video-editing software, students can engage in authentic self-expression in meaningful and satisfying ways. Insights into the ways in which engagement is generated can provide teachers with valuable knowledge when designing learning activities that incorporate DVP.",2022
108,The attitudes and motivation of children towards learning rarely spoken foreign languages: a case study from Saudi Arabia,L2 Motivational Self-System; SOLE; digital media; out-of-school context; JFL,ENGLISH; LEARNERS; FOCUS,"This article discusses the attitudes and motivations of two Saudi children learning Japanese as a foreign language (hence JFL), a language which is rarely spoken in the country. Studies regarding children's motivation for learning foreign languages that are not widely spread in their contexts in informal settings are scarce. The aim of the study described in this article was to understand what had motivated two Saudi children to learn Japanese outside the school context and how they viewed themselves as ideal JFL speakers in the future. The investigation builds on Dornyei's [2005. The Psychology of the Language Learner: Individual Differences in Second Language Acquisition. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum] theory of the L2 Motivational Self-System. Additionally, based on Mitra's [2012. Beyond the Hole in the Wall: Discover the Power of Self-Organised Learning. TED] concept of Self-Organised Learning Environment, the children's efforts to learn on their own by using digital resources were taken into consideration. The researcher's observations and the children's interviews and diaries have been employed in order to obtain in-depth understanding of their attitudes and motivation. Results revealed that the media had played a significant role in influencing the children's decision to learn Japanese and that they were able to use various digital language resources to support their learning without receiving formal instructions. The study provides pedagogical implications for educational authorities and researchers.",2018
109,Developing a genre-based model for assessing digital multimodal composing in second language writing: Integrating theory with practice,Digital multimodal composing; Writing assessment; Genre -based model; Writing instruction,ENGLISH; LITERACIES; LANGUAGE; PEDAGOGY; SCIENCE,"While previous research on digital multimodal composing (DMC) has examined the efficacy of either an element-based rubric or a process-based model that assesses students' DMC across stages, the important notion of genre and its value for DMC assessment remains underexplored and undertheorized. Given that as a new literacy practice in L2 writing and related fields, DMC covers a wide range of genres, a genre-based model that incorporates the composing elements and process for assessing DMC is warranted. Driven by theories of genre and multimodality, the study first proposed a multilayered framework that entails DMC structures, functions, modal features and selections. Then the theory-driven framework was tested and modified through collaborative action research with five teachers of a university English for general and academic purposes course in China. The study then drew on student-authored multimodal compositions, interviews and observations with the teachers in order to explore how the teachers assessed DMC, as well as the challenges they encountered. Based on the findings, a refined genre-based model that guides teachers to evaluate DMC as purpose-directed social actions to be constructed with apt multi -modal choices within and across four major layers (i.e., base units, layout, navigation, and rhetoric) was developed, with implications discussed.",2022

A diffractive methodology facilitated exploration of how the dynamic relationship-building between humans and nonhuman entities shaped the bi/multilingual learners' digital storytelling. The project intended to enable a generative assemblage that positioned languages, media, and places as interconnected, agentive repertoires. It supported bi/multilingual learners' connection-making with various semiotic resources and their situated lifeworlds and opened opportunities for them to create new forms of meaning.

After a vocabulary pre-test, a total of 132 participants performed three online reading tasks (in random orders) equipped with the following glossary types: (1) concordance lines and definitions of target lexical items, (2) concordance lines of target lexical items, and (3) no glossary information. Although the results of a previous study based on variable-centred analysis (i.e. multiple regression analysis) revealed that more glossary information could lead to better learning outcomes (Lee, Warschauer & Lee, 2017), using a model-based clustering technique in the present study allowed us to unearth learner types not identified in the previous analysis. Instead of the performance pattern found in the previous study (more glossary led to higher gains), we identified one learner group who exhibited their ability to make successful use of concordance lines (and thus are optimized for data-driven learning, or DDL; Johns, 1991), and another group who showed limited L2 vocabulary learning when exposed to concordance lines only. Further, our results revealed that L2 proficiency intersects with vocabulary gains of different learner types in complex ways. Therefore, using this technique in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) research to understand differential effects of accommodations can help us better identify hidden learner types and provide personalized CALL instruction.",2019
113,Digital Language Learning: A Sociocultural Theory Perspective,,FEEDBACK; LEARNERS,"The article reviews Digital Language Learning (DLL) research that has used principles and concepts of Sociocultural Theory (SCT) to support the research. We explain several key principles of the theory and shows how they have been misused or used in a superficial way in the DLL research. These include the assumption that SCT is a social rather than a psychological theory as well as misinterpretation of the central concepts of imitation and the Zone of Proximal Development. The article argues that the assumption that Virtual Reality pedagogy-which claims it is a means to avoid a parasitic relationship between L1 and L2-is problematic and not supported by an SCT perspective because the theory assigns a central role to L1 in all aspects of psychological development. It also argues that DLL pedagogy that seeks to avoid explicit instruction in favor of implicit learning through comprehensible input may well hinder full development of a new language. Finally, the article suggests ways in which DLL and SCT-based language pedagogy can be integrated into a coherent instructional program.",2023

To fill the gap, this multi-case study aimed to explore English as a foreign language adolescent learners' evolving perceptions of the role of DMC tasks in English learning and the relationship between the quality of DMC task outcomes and learners' perceptions over 7 months. Eight DMC tasks were implemented in an English composition class, and perceptions and task outcomes of three focal participants were tracked over time. Data were collected from multiple sources, such as a learner background questionnaire, a digital literacy questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, reflection surveys, and the scores of students' DMC tasks. Findings indicate that although all three participants acknowledged a beneficial role of DMC practices, each participant's perception exhibited different patterns over time: two kept the similar perceptions (negative and positive for each) and one showed a change in her perceptions (negative to positive). Results suggest that this difference could be attributed to various factors, including perceived level of digital literacy, the ongoing learning experience with DMC tasks, and understanding of multimodality. Regarding the relationship between the quality of DMC outcomes and students' perceptions, although all three learners tended to perform better on their tasks over time, participants' attitudes seemed to mediate the quality of DMC products. Pedagogical implications of the study are discussed in light of important considerations when implementing DMC tasks in L2 classrooms.",2023
115,Online Media Creation and L2 Motivation: A Socially Situated Perspective,,TECHNOLOGY; BLOGS,"Digital technologies are increasingly common in language learning. Online media creation provides scope for agency and spaces for identity construction, but empirically grounded conceptualizations of the influences on learners' motivation are lacking and the digital technology-second language motivation interface remains largely unexplored. Using a grounded theory ethnographic approach (Charmaz, 2006), and with the aim of developing a theoretical account of the emergence of motivation in online media creation, this study investigated a blog project in an English language classroom in Sweden. Engaging with multiple data sources, and using Ito and colleagues' (2010) theory of participation in media practices as an analytical framework, motivation is conceptualized as stemming from the desire to create a visually appealing and authentic artefact, from a perception of audience, and through the documentation of identities. Variations in motivational intensity between student groups could be traced to varying investments in digital media practices. Primarily, differences were between validation-seeking that was locally oriented and validation-seeking conditioned through actions within a genre of practice. These conceptualizations are of importance for English language teaching. In language-developing activities that involve online media creation, motivation can be enhanced when space for genre exploration is provided.",2019

Despite the fast-growing interest in CW, little research has considered assessment practices in computer-mediated CW. To fill this gap, this study examines the effects of assessment approaches (product-based vs. process-and-product based) on learners' performance and collaboration dynamics in web-based CW. Eighty-two intermediate tertiary-level learners formed a control and an experimental group. The control group (n = 20 pairs) was introduced to the traditional product-based assessment prior to completing a synchronous CW task, whereas the experimental group (n = 21 pairs) was presented an assessment approach addressing both the collaboration process and product. Drawing upon analyses of dyads' interaction, revision pro-cesses, and the co-constructed texts, the study found that the experimental group produced texts of enhanced fluency, writing quality, and phrasal complexity. Also, they displayed strikingly more collaboration during the task. The study not only provides a practical approach for L2 teachers to assess collaborative writing in the digital age, but also provides findings that underscore the value of the process-and-product based assessment for remedying challenges presented in web-based CW.",2022
117,Investigation of Native Speaker and Second Language Learner Intuition of Collocation Frequency,collocation frequency; intuition; corpus; native speakers; L2 learners; Italian,WORD-FREQUENCY; EYE-TRACKING; AGREEMENT; USAGE,"Research into frequency intuition has focused primarily on native (L1) and, to a lesser degree, nonnative (L2) speaker intuitions about single word frequency. What remains a largely unexplored area is L1 and L2 intuitions about collocation (i.e., phrasal) frequency. To bridge this gap, the present study aimed to answer the following question: How do L2 learners and native speakers compare against each other and corpora in their subjective judgments of collocation frequency? Native speakers and learners of Italian were asked to judge 80 noun-adjective pairings as one of the following: high frequency, medium frequency, low frequency, very low frequency. Both L1 and L2 intuitions of high frequency collocations correlated strongly with corpus frequency. Neither of the two groups of participants exhibited accurate intuitions of medium and low frequency collocations. With regard to very low frequency pairings, L1 but not L2 intuitions were found to correlate with corpora for the majority of the items. Further, mixed-effects modeling revealed that L2 learners were comparable to native speakers in their judgments of the four frequency bands, although some differences did emerge. Taken together, the study provides new insights into the nature of L1 and L2 intuitions about phrasal frequency.",2015
118,Comparing monomodal traditional writing and digital multimodal composing in EAP classrooms: Linguistic performance and writing development,,ENGLISH; LITERACIES; LEARNERS; SELF,"In response to mixed perceptions about the digital multimodal composing (DMC) approach to conceptualizing and teaching second language (L2) writing, the purpose of the current study is to compare students' linguistic performance on traditional monomodal writing and DMC tasks, as well as writing development over time under traditional and DMC instructional conditions. A total of 41 Korean university English as a foreign language (EFL) students were randomly assigned to two instructional groups: traditional writing and DMC. Over one semester, both the DMC and the traditional writing groups completed TOEFL-style independent writing pretests and posttests, and depending on their intervention condition, they completed either monomodal writing or DMC tasks for two elemental genres (causal analysis and argumentation). For the first research question, focused on output of traditional writing and DMC tasks, the two groups' language use on each of the two assigned genres (causal analysis and argumentation) was analyzed separately, and their linguistic performance was compared using independent t-tests. For the second research question, the pretest and posttest essays were scored using an analytic rubric focused on content, organization and language, and the two groups' timed writing performance was compared using linear mixed effect models. The findings indicated that students produced longer texts for DMC tasks, and that there were significant gains in writing development over time for both DMC and traditional writing instructed groups. The DMC-integrated group, however, showed greater gains. Pedagogical implications for the use of DMC in L2 writing instruction are discussed.",2023

The article presents the philosophy underpinning the project, highlights some of the innovations introduced, e.g. the use of logfiles for compiling the initial lemma list and the order of compilation, and illustrates a compilation methodology which starts by assuming the relevance of new concepts, i.e. object and auxiliary languages instead of target and source languages. The contribution also defends the premise that the future of e-lexicography basically rests on a close cooperation between research centers and high-tech companies which assures the adequate use of disruptive technologies and innovations.",2018

L2 learning occurs only when the semiotic resources in the environment resonate with the learner's capacities such as their abilities, aptitudes, and attitudes. Adopting affordance as a theoretical and analytic construct, this study investigates using qualitative research methods what language development affordances WeChat, one of the most popular Social Networking Systems in Chinese-speaking communities, provided to two university-level Chinese language learners while they were studying abroad in an intensive language program in Shanghai. Four affordances were identified. The results also show that each affordance was manifested differently with each language learner due to unique communication norms on WeChat, each language learner's Chinese language proficiency, and their personal preference in WeChat communication. Pedagogical implications are also provided to guide educators and L2 users as to how to take advantage of WeChat for language learning.",2018

122,FOSTERING COMPUTER-MEDIATED L2 INTERACTION BEYOND THE CLASSROOM,,,"In language learning contexts a primary concern is how to maximise target language interaction both inside and outside of the classroom. With the development of digital technologies, the proliferation of language learning applications, and an increased awareness of how technology can assist in language education, educators are being presented with new opportunities to engage learners in innovative ways. This article reports on how technology was used to deal with the issue of an identified lack of English language interactional opportunities outside of the classroom at the author's university in Japan. An Action Research (AR) project was initiated with a Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) programme being implemented during an eight-week summer vacation period, in order to provide a platform for students to interact in the target language outside of class. The article reports on the action research methodology undertaken and the results of the CMC programme interactions. It shows that a CMC programme can offer students a convenient and useful platform on which to continue to communicate in the target language while outside of their classes, but that the construction of the platform needs input from both teachers and students.",2012

Learners can collaborate with like-minded peers in online affinity spaces or get crowd-sourced information from the locals of a target culture, but they also run the risk of getting lost in the overwhelming amount of noise and disruption in these 'wild' environments. This proliferation of user-generated content requires new forms of information literacy, so that everyone has equal access and ability to participate in modern social environments. English language learners (ELLs) may require extra training in using English-based social media effectively, but to date little research has examined this area. This study investigated the characteristics and trends of ELLs' use of social media, how language abilities and previous social media experience affect ELLs' perceptions of anonymous user-generated content in an online discussion website (Reddit), and the strategies learners use to overcome the challenges they encounter in these online environments. The results indicate the importance of adding a sociocultural pragmatics component into the framework of social media literacy and were used to inform recommendations for future social media training programs.",2022

The starting point is the observation that in the academic L2 writing process the extensive information potential of monolingual, bilingual and multilingual lexicographic and lexico-grammatical online resources as well as other language technology tools is not adequately known. Accordingly, the many digital language resources are not optimally used for methods of teaching vocabulary and acting with it, e.g. in academic writing. On the other hand, digital media occupy more and more space in our everyday life and also provide highly developed tools based on linguistic technology for various L2 competence areas, such as translation. The aim of this paper is therefore both to show ways of making sensible use of existing internet resources and to outline entirely new ways based on artificial intelligence. Selected resources will be used as examples to demonstrate the extensive information potential and to discuss possibilities for use in academic writing. An outlook points to the necessity of adapting to revolutionary technological changes in the field of foreign language didactics.",2023

The test was administered during emergency remote teaching when many L2 courses navigated creative solutions to online testing. Situated in an ab initio Mandarin Chinese course in New Zealand, 163 students' first-time digital compositions in Chinese and responses to an immediate follow-up survey on their translanguaging practices were analysed as part of evaluating a new assessment design. Students' digital compositions demonstrated purposeful translanguaging in assessment conditions, judiciously negotiating their existing linguistic knowledge when completing the task. The writing assessment showed augmented task completion when learners' trans-semiotic repertoires were recognised as a legitimate resource for identity expression. The survey found that most students supported the creative design that integrated digital multimodal composition and translanguaging, replacing the monolingually-focused handwriting-based test tasks. Some students were sceptical of the translanguaging approach and found it unexpected, unnecessary, and inauthentic. The study suggests that L2 writing test design might incorporate translanguaging as a creative and transformative assessment facet to genuinely engage beginning learners in meaningful writing tasks when their proficiency level is limited.",2023

Sixty undergraduate English learners at a university in China played a digital game, developed at the researcher's institution, involving 10 hypothetical request-making interactions that took place on a university campus. For each interaction, participants read a brief scenario description and watched a video that depicts that scenario. After watching the video, they were presented with four options of request-making expressions and asked to select the most desirable expression directed to the speaker in each video. Each option was linked to specific reactions depicted by speakers in the videos (perlocutionary effects). After choosing a response, participants were shown a reaction video designed to give feedback on the appropriateness of their selected response. Recognition and production tests were used for pre, post, and delayed posttests to assess participants' knowledge of targeted request-making forms. Results revealed a significant gain from the pre to immediate posttest in both modalities, but the gain was not retained at delayed posttest. The effect from game-based instruction appeared larger in the production (Cohen's d = 0.83) than in the recognition test (d = 0.45).

THE EFFECTS OF DIGITAL GAME PLAY ON WILLINGNESS TO COMMUNICATE,Computer-Assisted Language Learning; Language Play; Second Language Acquisition,FOREIGN-LANGUAGE; EFL CLASSROOM; 2ND-LANGUAGE; ATTITUDES; JAPANESE; ENGLISH; MODEL; L2,"This paper reports on a study into the effects of digital game play on learners' Willingness to Communicate (WTC), or individuals' readiness to enter into discourse at a particular time with a specific person or persons, using a L2 (MacIntyre, Dornyei, Clement, & Noels, 1998, p. 547). Thirty Thai learners of English as a foreign language enrolled in a University language course completed six 90-minute lessons playing Ragnarok Online, a popular online role-playing game. The game had been installed on a private server and was thus only available to participants in the study. We modified the game to include special instructions, or quests (missions that players are assigned to accomplish in order to get items and progress throughout the game), designed to encourage collaboration and communication. To gauge participants' WTC, a series of questionnaires was designed, adapted from MacIntyre et al's (2001) WTC scale and previous studies on language and communication anxiety (Horwitz, Horwitz, & Cope, 1986; McCroskey & Richmond, 1982) and perceived competence (Compton, 2004; MacIntyre & Charos, 1996). These asked respondents about their (own perceptions of their) willingness to use English, as well as their confidence, anxiety, and perceived communicative competence in communicating in English. The questionnaires were administered at the start of the course, and again after six gaming sessions. Results on the first set of questionnaires showed that students had low confidence, high anxiety, low perceived competence, and low WTC. The second set of results showed a marked and significant improvement, with participants feeling more confident, less anxious, more competent, and more willing to communicate. We argue that the careful construction of tasks that draw on the affordances of games can have a positive effect on the language learning process.",2014

A total of 69 EFL learners were recruited from two intact classes and assigned to either an experimental (the DST-based online flipped learning approach) or comparison (the online flipped learning approach) group, in order to explore the effects of the DST-based online flipped learning approach on learners' WTC. The quantitative data were obtained from the learners' WTC questionnaire. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to gauge the students' perceptions of the different learning approaches.FindingsThe quantitative results demonstrated that the experimental group outperformed the comparison group in terms of WTC at the end of the experiment. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data also lent support to the contribution of this DST-based online flipped learning approach in terms of boosting their English speaking confidence and encouraging more meaningful interaction and collaboration with others.Originality/valueFindings from this study offer insights into integrating the DST-based online flipped learning approach as an instructional implementation of technology-enhanced task-based language learning (TETBLT) in COVID/ post-COVID times.

All participants in both interventions (N = 52) completed two writing tasks before and after the intervention (in a pretestposttest design). Participants in a nonintervention group (N = 32)did the same before and after a two-week holiday in which they did not receive writing instruction. Participants' output was assessed by analytic CAF-measures as well as for communicative effectiveness. Multilevel analyses revealed significantly greater growth for both intervention groups compared to the non-intervention group. The in-school group showed growth for six measures (complexity and text length on one task and communicative effectiveness, content, lexical diversity and text length on the other). Also the out-of-school group revealed greater gains for six measures (complexity on one task and content, two measures of syntactic complexity, lexical diversity and text length on the other). In all, this study shows that multimodal composition can promote writing of beginner L2 learners, regardless of the exact context in which the writing takes place. Furthermore, the study shows the importance of using multiple measures and multiple tasks to evaluate writing development.",2017

This study investigated and compared the motivational profiles of first-year and second-year students majoring in Spanish, grounded on the proposition of bifurcating ideal and ought selves into Own and Other standpoints, and the importance of learning experience. The data were first collected using Q methodology from 27 freshmen and 20 sophomores at a university in China, followed by interviews with 10 students. The findings showed three motivational profiles in the first-year group (self-imposed with instrumental goals, self-motivated with intrinsic interests, other-informed and malleable to context) and two in the second-year group (self-motivated with embryonic ideal self-images, ought-self oriented with unsatisfactory classroom experience). These different motivational profiles were found to be associated with two main factors: classroom experience and exposure to Spanish use in digital contexts. The current findings underscored the importance of role modelling and positive classroom learning experience for beginning learners in LOTE degree programmes, and the promising potential of exposing learners to LOTE use in digital contexts.",2022
131,Tracking the Real-Time Evolution of a Writing Event: Second Language Writers at Different Proficiency Levels,English; second language; writing processes; multimodal data; temporal dimension; digital screen capture; eye tracking,EYE-TRACKING; ESL STUDENTS; LANGUAGE; INPUTLOG; BEHAVIOR; L1,"The current study focused on emergent processes during real-time second language (L2) writing activity in an English as a foreign language university context, examining differences in these processes across individual capacities. Participants included 22 adult Japanese learners of L2 English and their tutor. The data were collected using digital screen capture and eye-tracking technologies while the learners wrote a 35-minute argumentative essay. Supplementary stimulated retrospective recalls were also conducted to document the learners' and the tutor's reflections on the writing event. Results revealed clear differences in L2 writing activity at different periods in time as well as differences in cognitive activity that appear to be mediated by L2 proficiency. Importantly, the obtained patterns differed depending on whether duration or frequency data were considered. These findings thus demonstrate the need to broaden the study of the temporal dimension of L2 writing and to consider more nuanced mixed-methods approaches in future work.",2018
132,The effects of concordance-based electronic glosses on L2 vocabulary learning,Corpus; Literacy; Multimodal Texts; Reading; Vocabulary,READING-COMPREHENSION; LANGUAGE,"The present study investigates the effects of two different vocabulary learning conditions in digital reading environments equipped with electronic textual glossing. The first condition presents the concordance lines of a target lexical item, thereby making learners infer its meaning by reading the referenced sentences. The second condition additionally offers the definition of a target lexical item after learners consult the concordance lines, thus enabling learners to confirm their meaning inference. A total of 138 English as a Foreign Language students completed a meaning-recall vocabulary pre-test, and three different reading tasks, which were followed by meaning-recall vocabulary post-tests in a repeated measures design with a control condition. Overall, the findings showed that the second condition resulted in higher vocabulary gains than both the first condition and the control condition. Yet, a closer look at the interactions of (a) the participants' clicking behaviors, (b) the difficulty of selected concordance lines, (c) the surrounding contexts around target lexical items, and (d) the participants' prior knowledge of the target lexical items showed that each target lexical item may require different treatments for it to be recalled most efficiently and effectively. Through this investigation, the present study suggests that glossary information, such as concordance lines, may involve more complex and unexpected learner interactions.",2017
133,The Influence of Game-Enhanced Communication on EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence in Compliment Responses,,DIGITAL GAME; L2; CHINESE; ENGLISH; PRONUNCIATION; PLAY,"A small number of studies have explored the effects of digital gaming on second/foreign language (L2) pragmatic competence. However, the effectiveness of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) germane to L2 pragmatic development remains unclear because most game-mediated pragmatics studies have focused on educational games. Adopting the interactionist approach, this pretest-immediate-posttest-delayed-posttest study investigated the influence of an MMORPG on L2 learners' pragmatic competence in compliment responses. Specifically, 105 English-as-a-foreign-language learners from a university in China interacted with L1-English-speaking players in World of Warcraft for four weeks. Unlike most studies that have conducted discourse completion tasks for data collection, compliment responses were gathered through computer-mediated communication with L1-English-speaking interlocutors on WeChat. Results showed that the learners tended to deny compliments on the pretest, whereas they preferred to accept praise on the immediate and delayed posttests. Implications for language policy-making and teaching are discussed regarding the usefulness of MMORPGs for learners who are not immersed in the environment of the target language or have few opportunities to go abroad to experience various social contexts in an L2.",2023

The current study extends prior work by unifying motivational selves, attributions of learning, and perceptions of suppressed self-authenticity, a topic not previously explored in China. Using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM), we examined English learner motivational selves, self-authenticity, and attributions. Young adult learners in rural China (n = 371) completed surveys addressing motivational selves, attributions, self-authenticity (general and in digital environments), L2 English effort, and daily language use. Results replicated those of Henry and Cliffordson (2017) for initial hypotheses related to motivational selves; current and ideal selves were statistically significant predictors of effort, in line with prior studies in the Chinese context. However, results among this sample supported discrete constructs for ideal L2 and current L2 self and provide evidence of a separable sub-component of self-authenticity, digital self-authenticity. In addition, we extend Henry and Cliffordson (2017) by exploring alternative pathways to L2 effort including a unified comprehensive SEM that included ideal L2 self, current L2 self, learning locus, attributions, suppressed self-authenticity. Finally, we discuss implications for specifically addressing digital environments in language learning research. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Superscript/Subscript Available",2020

For second language (L2) grammar learning, some studies reveal advantages for spacing of 7 days or more, but others for shorter spacing. Further, little is known about the role of cognitive individual differences (e.g., language analytic ability; LAA) in mediating practice distribution effects for L2 grammatical knowledge development and retention. To address this gap, this classroom-based study investigated whether distribution of practice and LAA moderated the effectiveness of explicit, input-based grammar instruction for young first language (L1) English learners of French (aged 8 to 11). The study revealed minimal differences between longer (7-day) versus shorter (3.5-day) spacing of practice for learning a French verb inflection subsystem, at either posttest or delayed posttest. Minimal group-level gains and substantial within-group variation in performance at posttests were observed. Accuracy of practice during training and LAA were significantly associated with posttest performance under both practice schedules. These findings indicated that within an ecologically valid classroom context, differences in distribution of practice had limited impact on learner performance on our tests; rather, individual learner differences were more critical in moderating learning. This highlights the importance of considering individual learner differences in the development of resources and the potential of digital tools for dynamically adapting instruction to suit individuals.",2019

Moreover, following the Desirable Difficulty Framework for L2 practice, the present study investigated whether lag effects could be explained by other sources of difficulty. Using digital flashcards, 117 English language learners (aged 10-18) learned two grammatical structures over two different sessions at a 1-day or 7-day intersession interval (ISI). Learners' performance was analyzed at two retention intervals (RIs) of 7 and 28 days, respectively. Linguistic difficulty was compared by examining two different structures, while learner-related difficulty was analyzed by comparing learners who differed in terms of age, proficiency, and time required to complete the training. Results showed no main effect of ISI, a main effect of RI, and a small but significant ISI x RI interaction. Linguistic difficulty and age did not interact with ISI or RI. However, longer lags led to significantly higher scores for faster learners and learners of higher proficiency, while shorter lags promoted significantly higher scores for slower learners and learners of lower proficiency. The findings provide some support for the Desirable Difficulty Framework in its potential to explain L2 lag effects.",2022
137,"Examining the Effect of Digital Storytelling on English Speaking Proficiency, Willingness to Communicate, and Group Cohesion",,GROUP-DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGY; MOTIVATION; CONFIDENCE; LEARNERS; MODEL; L2,"This study focused on digital storytelling (DST) as a task in technology-mediated task-based language teaching and examined its effects on English speaking proficiency, willingness to communicate in English (WTCE), and group cohesion (GC). Two intact classes of Taiwanese EFL students, either as the DST group or as the comparison group, first responded to the WTCE scale, the GC scale, and a standardized English speaking test. Next, the DST group completed two DST tasks, each of which entailed locating information, generating the story script, obtaining visual and aural support, rehearsing and recording the oral reading, combining the visual and aural support with the audio recording to create the digital story, and playing the digital story and then telling the story again with the muted digital story in class. During the weeks when the DST group presented digital stories, the comparison group watched and discussed movies and composed a reflective report in English. Finally, both groups responded to the WTCE scale and GC scale again and took another set of the standardized English speaking test. Data analyses disclosed that DST tasks significantly increased English speaking proficiency and GC but affected WTCE in a positive yet nonsignificant manner.",2023
138,"The effects of digital game-based instruction, teacher instruction, and direct focused written corrective feedback on the grammatical accuracy of English articles",Game-based learning; error correction; English articles; corrective feedback; grammar instruction,ERROR-CORRECTION; EFL; ACQUISITION,"Feedback researchers have given little attention to how administration of language-focused instruction before writing in a second language combined with subsequent error correction after writing can affect the grammatical accuracy of learners' future writing. Moreover, the mode of the instruction (i.e., teacher instruction or game-based instruction) has also been undervalued. To address these gaps in the research literature, Taiwanese university student participants (n = 45) were randomly and equally divided into two experimental and one control group: teacher instruction with error correction; digital game-based instruction with error correction; and error correction only. Participants were asked to write three letters of application to three similar job advertisements as a pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest. Gain score results in the immediate posttest showed that the teacher instruction with error correction group significantly outperformed the error correction only group whereas gains in the delayed posttest showed the teacher instruction with error correction and the digital game-based instruction with error correction groups significantly outperformed the error correction only group. Results indicate that pedagogical practices that provide focused grammatical instruction with direct focused feedback are more beneficial to L2 writers than only providing error correction. Furthermore, the just-in-time grammar feedback provided during game play afforded learners with opportunities to engage in awareness-raising language related episodes. Such game play combined with written corrective feedback resulted in stronger retention of grammatical knowledge compared to learners that received teacher instruction combined with written corrective feedback.",2021

The Role of Relearning in Second Language Grammar Acquisition",digital flashcards; grammar practice; relearning; skill acquisition theory; skill retention theory,RETRIEVAL PRACTICE; VOCABULARY; SCHEDULES; MAINTENANCE; RETENTION; KNOWLEDGE; BENEFITS; MEMORY; COSTS,"This study investigated how much practice is necessary for learners to attain durable second language (L2) grammar knowledge. Using digital flashcards, 119 participants practiced translating 12 sentences into an artificial language, followed by feedback, until they had typed all sentences correctly. Participants repeated this activity in one, two, three, or four relearning sessions on consecutive days. After a 14-day delay, all groups scored highly on a receptive test. However, scores on a productive test were substantially higher for groups with three or four relearning sessions. Accuracy tended to peak on the 3rd day of training. An analysis by individual training performance revealed that participants attained durable productive knowledge if they completed two sessions without errors, regardless of how many sessions they had performed in total. The findings provide a timeframe for processes described in skill retention theory (Kim et al., 2013) and suggest a performance benchmark to indicate when learners have gained procedural L2 grammar knowledge.",2024

This radical turn from traditional content curriculum toward inquiry-based approaches to teaching raises issues about the promise and potential challenges of contemporary curriculum in K-12 L2 settings. This explorative qualitative study investigated the following research question: What are the opportunities and challenges for inquiry-based approaches to English language learners' (ELLs) language, literacies, and content learning, as mandated in twenty-first-century curriculum? Semi-structured interviews, with eight expert language and literacy educators, were conducted to generate data and a thematic analysis of the data was undertaken. The recursive analysis revealed three themes concerning opportunities afforded by an inquiry-based approach: enhance ELLs' understanding of content knowledge, give prominence to ELLs' languages and literacies and promote respect for diversity, and utilize digital tools to support ELLs' language and content learning and amplify their voices. Three themes concerning challenges emerged: educator resistance to change, underestimating required resources, and communicating with parents/guardians of ELLs. Implications are discussed for policy and practices regarding inquiry-based pedagogies, multimodalities, and multilingualism in supporting English learner success.",2020
141,Nonoccurrence of Negotiation of Meaning in Task-Based Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication,negotiation of meaning; task-based language teaching; L2 learning; video conferencing; chat; SCMC,LANGUAGE PLAY; HUMOR; DISCOURSE; RESPONSES; LEARNERS; ISSUES,"This empirical study investigated the occurrence of meaning negotiation in an interactive synchronous computer-mediated second language (L2) environment. Sixteen dyads (N = 32) consisting of nonnative speakers (NNSs) and native speakers (NSs) of English performed 2 different tasks using videoconferencing and written chat. The data were coded and analyzed both for instances of negotiation of meaning and for instances where the NNSs did not initiate repair despite nonunderstanding. Absences of negotiation of meaning are generally excluded from detailed analysis primarily because it is difficult to establish nonunderstanding unless the participant overtly indicates it. In order to assess the effect of the nonoccurrence of negotiation of meaning on task performance and task completion, this study used 2 tasks: a culturally specific task that almost certainly would result in NNS nonunderstanding and a collaborative decision-making task that should trigger instances of negotiation of meaning. It was found that, in both tasks, instead of initiating repair sequences, NNS participants frequently did not engage in negotiation of meaning despite nonunderstanding. We conclude that disregarding nonoccurrence of negotiation of meaning in (digital) task-based language teaching may lead to misrepresenting task performance, task outcome, and task evaluation, and, beyond that, to disregarding evidence that has both empirical and theoretical consequences for the Interaction Hypothesis and, by implication, for second language acquisition.",2016
142,Automatic profiling of L2-simplified texts: Identifying discriminate features of linguistic proficiency,,READABILITY,"We describe the first wide results of the linguistic profiling of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)-levelled English Corpus (CLEC), a corpus built up for Natural Language Processing purposes. The CLEC is a proficiency-levelled English corpus that covers A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1 CEFR levels and that has been built up to train statistic models for automatic proficiency assessment. We describe not only the main aspects of the corpus development but also display the linguistic features and the statistic results for levels A2, B1, and B2 written examples, carried out automatically. We show how raw text, lexical, morphosyntactic, or syntactic statistic outcomes can help to identify levels of proficiency, to test teaching materials accurate proficiency classification, to provide computable support to new text proficiency validation, and to specify level boundaries. In fact, upper levels strengthen proficiency by showing higher outcomes of lexical and syntactic complexity. This analysis validates the use of automatic tools for proficiency level identification based on lexical and syntactic data, whereas morphosyntactic features strengthen competence-level distinctions. Finally, we suggest that these results are a first step onto the CEFR-levelled automatic assessment of new texts.",2019

We will present a new model of L2 learning interaction that is a schematic representation of two main types of hearer response that have been found after a trigger of nonunderstanding: Task-appropriate response (TAR) and face-appropriate response (FAR). In addition, we outline five different discourse trajectories. The model we propose is based on data derived from interactive task performances of groups of Dutch and Australian students in two telecollaboration projects. The discourse trajectories represented in our model provide us with useful insights into the complexities of digital interaction in an L2-learning environment and show that NNS-NS communication is more complex than traditional negotiation of meaning models suggest. We expect our model to contribute to a better understanding of L2 learning processes related to interaction in digital settings.",2019
145,Exploring AI-mediated informal digital learning of English (AI-IDLE): a mixed-method investigation of Chinese EFL learners' AI adoption and experiences,AI-IDLE; Language learning beyond the classroom; GPT technologies; technology acceptance model; AI literacies,PERCEIVED EASE; ACCEPTANCE; LANGUAGE; MODEL,"Recent advancements in natural language processing and large language models have ushered language learning into the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Recognizing the affordances of generative AI tools, this paper aims to examine the degree to which L2 learners accepted and leveraged large language model platforms (e.g. ChatGPT, Bing Chat) for the informal digital learning of English (IDLE) purposes. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design, this study draws on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and collects data via an adapted TAM questionnaire and an interview guide. A total of 867 Chinese EFL (English as a foreign language) learners answered the online survey, while 20 attended the post-survey interviews. Drawing on a validated structural model that elucidates the inter-factor relationships of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intention to use, and actual use, the quantitative analysis provides statistical accounts for EFL learners' adoption of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technologies. The qualitative findings, derived from the interview data, reveal three key themes: (1) how perceived usefulness of chatbots for IDLE emerges from hands-on experimentation with these tools; (2) how intention to use increases as learners negotiate chatbot affordances and constraints; and (3) how actual use of chatbots for IDLE involves using these tools as tutors or conversation partners. Connections between quantitative and qualitative findings enhance our understanding of how EFL learners negotiate the affordances and constraints of highly capable AI technologies to participate in creative IDLE practices. By understanding these practices, this study draws attention to the attitudes and practices that constitute AI literacies, ultimately offering implications for future classroom practices and research.",2024
146,"Online linguistic resources: Contexts, practices and challenges",Data-driven learning; digital literacy; online reading and writing; corpus linguistics; computer-assisted-translation,,"Based on 30 in-deep semi-structured interviews, we explore how 59 Spanish multilingual college students (11-17 year olds) use digital language resources ( translators, dictionaries, checkers) in their daily literacy practices within and outside the classroom. Previous studies analyse these resources (Buyse, 2014) and their affordances for verbal learning (Sinclair, 2004), but we lack ethnographic descriptions of the actual queries of each of these resources and the communicative contexts in which they occur. Our data suggest that the most popular resource is the translator in L2 reading and L1 / L2 writing situations, followed by the dictionary and the checker in schools and private contexts. These attitudes and practices establish differences between a basic user, who employs any mechanical and uncritical resource, and a sophisticated and autonomous user, who consciously chooses the resource in context and shows refined knowledge and skills and verifies the results obtained with several strategies (backtranslation, use of a third language, comparison of resources, photographs). These practices contrast with teachers' point of view who advise the non usage of translators, and recommend well-known dictionaries and grammars and prohibit the use of certain resources in classrooms. Among other findings, we recommend the formal instructiton for students in the use of these resources and the development of a more detailed research on this emerging field.",2016

One hundred and fifty two texts generated by 38 graduate students within the context of the same Master's level course were analysed using Coh-Metrix indices at the surface code, textbase and situation model levels. The two text types differed in their lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, use of cohesion and agency. Overall, the traditional course assignments were more formal, lexically sophisticated and syntactically complex, while the blog posts contained more semantic and situational redundancy, resulting in higher readability, and communicated a clearer sense of agency. There were also reliable differences between the textual artefacts generated by the L1 and L2 writers, one of which was a more traditional impersonal academic style of the L2 texts. Although no interaction was observed between the two independent variables in the Coh-Metrix analyses, an additional analysis of human ratings showed that the blog posts were rated lower on the use of language than traditional assignments for the L2, but not L1, writers. Limitations of the computational text analysis and pedagogical implications of the findings are considered.",2017

Findings revealed that ideal self accounted for significant variance in school effort (12%), but less than previously found in other contexts. L1/L2 reading attitudes had a significant negative relationship; the more enjoyable reading in English, the less enjoyable reading in Chinese. Chinese reading activity in digital environments uniquely accounted for significant variance in school effort.

We compared time-telling in Greek and English, which differ in time-telling word order (hour vs. minute mentioned first), by contrasting Greek-English bilinguals speaking in their L1-Greek or their L2-English, and English monolingual speakers. All three groups were faster when telling the time for digital than for analogue clocks, and when telling the time for the first half-hour than the second half-hour. Critically, first fixation and gaze duration analyses for the hour and minute regions showed a different pattern for Greek-English bilinguals when speaking in their L1 versus L2, with the latter resembling that of English monolinguals. Our results suggest that bilingual speakers' eye-movement programming was influenced by the type of time-telling utterance specific to the language of production currently in use.",2014

This paper focuses on the incorporation of digital technologies into translator training by comparing the benefits and drawbacks of wikis, a collaborative online writing and editing tool, and face-to-face communication. In the study, trainee translators' performance in and attitudes towards face-to-face and digital revision are examined. Two groups of 12 trainee translators were asked to complete two pair-work assignments involving translation and revision: in the first, the participants were engaged in face-to-face interaction, while wiki collaboration was used in the second. The results show that the number of revisions was higher in wiki assignments, but there were no differences in the types of revisions. A short questionnaire shows that the participants' opinions of both modes of revision were positive: face-to-face revision was deemed somewhat easier and more efficient in terms of communication, whereas wiki revision was considered more effective in terms of time management. These findings call for further exploration of issues, such as pair dynamics, communication and flexibility, and their impact on the application of wikis to translator training.",2020

However, whether mobile platforms lead to a comprehensive mastery of both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge has seldom been addressed in previous literature. This study investigated English vocabulary learning from engagement with mobile-based word cards and paper word cards in the context of the Chinese university classroom. A total of 85 undergraduate students were recruited to take part in the study. The students were divided into two groups, a mobile learning group and a paper-based learning group, and tested on two word knowledge components: receptive knowledge of the form-meaning connection and productive knowledge of collocations. Both the digital and non-digital word cards enhanced L2 vocabulary learning, and the results showed that the mobile application (app) promoted greater gains than physical word cards.",2022

Sixty child EFL learners were assigned to two experimental groups. During the treatment, one group completed simple information transmission tasks, whereas the other group performed complex decision-making tasks. In response to errors in the use of the present third person singular verb forms, participants received recasts. L2 development was measured through oral production, written production, and elicited imitation tests. Aptitude was assessed through LLAMA D, LLAMA E, and LLAMA F. Less cognitively demanding tasks were more beneficial. Participants' performance on LLAMA E predicted L2 gains measured through elicited imitation, and their LLAMA D scores predicted development measured through the oral and written production tests under complex task conditions.

153,Technology for a tasked-based language learning curriculum,computer-assisted language learning (CALL); tutorial CALL; social CALL; task-based language learning; second language acquisition (SLA); teaching Spanish as a second language,,"Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) takes place in two educational environments: (1) tutorial CALL, where students interact with and learn from digital materials and programs in a self-directed manner; and (2) social CALL, the computer provides the medium where students can interact with each other at a distance. Each mode offers specific benefits that contribute to second-language learning, especially if the activities students are asked to complete are framed within an overarching task-based learning approach (Gonzalez Lloret y Ortega 2014). Digital exchanges, such as those found in social media or synchronous videoconferences, have had a profound impact on how people communicate and can be adapted to support L2 learning as well. Nevertheless, tutorial CALL still has a valued place in the curriculum when one considers the need to develop a sufficiently large L2 vocabulary and the challenges of a controlling a new morphosyntactic system.

Considering that tasks are dynamic in nature and subject to constant change from their initial design to implementation by L2 learners, there is a need for teacher training activities promoting opportunities for improving the required digital and pedagogical competences. With this in mind, this paper sets out to explore the interactional architecture of the multiple steps involved in the training of pre-service language teachers in pedagogical task design for telecollaboration-oriented video-mediated interactional settings. We describe the procedural unfolding of the telecollaborative tasks by analyzing (i) pre-service teachers' collaborative design meetings and (ii) written design reports; (iii) peer and mentor evaluation of these design ideas in whole-class feedback sessions in teacher training classrooms; (iv) written reports of redesigns after the feedback session, (v) video-mediated implementation by telecollaborative task participants, and finally (vi) pre-service teachers' written reflections based on the implementation of their own designs. We use Conversation Analysis to closely examine audio and screen-recording data and draw on the textual data to present the procedural unfolding of two tasks over multiple phases, namely design, feedback, implementation, and reflection. The findings show that a telecollaborative task is a co-construction by the pre-service teachers as task designers, the teacher trainer as the mentor, and the L2 learners as the end users in interactionally trackable ways across the teacher education events. The results bring insights into the novel sets of digital, pedagogical, and interactional competencies in L2 contexts. We conclude that task enhanced telecollaboration holds great potential to critically advance research and practice in L2 teaching and teacher education worldwide.",2024

Most recently, the emergence of AI-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has led to calls for a revision of traditional teaching methods to prioritize reflective reasoning and critical thinking. This article studies the potentialities of Applied Translation (AT) to promote essential critical thinking skills needed to engage effectively with AI-based tools in the L2 classroom. We present the IMI+ framework (Integration, Multimodality, and Interaction) for integrating AT in language education, which helps support the development of digital literacy and critical thinking in L2 classrooms. Furthermore, given the challenges related to privacy and ethics inherent in these new technologies, we propose applying a Critical Ecological Approach (CEA) to AT to help learners navigate those challenges by identifying power imbalances and societal inequities. Finally, we explain how the seven articles in this special issue showcase the potential applications of AT in Spanish language education.",2023

This study replicated, with modifications, prior study of syntactic enhancement and secondary school EFL Students' reading fluency in South Korea. The current project investigated the impact of visual-syntactic text formatting (VSTF) on developing ERF components (i.e., parsing skills, reading speed, and comprehension) in an Iranian context. In order to reformat block-formatted English text in a way to be more concise, the VSTF technology was used. For 20 weeks, two experimental groups (76 intermediate EFL students) read reformatted passages, whereas the control group (n = 38) read their block-formatted textbook. After analyzing the pre-and post-test results, it was demonstrated that reformatted texts could support EFL students to enhance their ERF elements. The researchers also found that VSTF can be used as a syntactic enhancement, making it simpler for EFL learners to receive English syntactic information as input. Findings have led to the reasonable interpretation that learning L2 reading fluency components (RFC) was more productive when the VSTF technology was utilized for the learning processes.",2022

Absent in this vision of language are notions of pragmatic, sociolinguistic, and multicultural competencies. Although current linguistic theories posit a more complex, interactive, and integrated model of language, this review article points out where computer-assisted language learning (CALL) can contribute to L2 language growth in terms of these four skills, especially if carefully situated within a task-based language teaching (TBLT) framework. New technologies coupled with a TBLT goal-oriented approach ultimately push learners to combine speaking, listening, reading, and writing in ways that resemble more closely how they normally engage with the digital facets of their own lives.",2016
158,Using learning analytics to understand collective attention in language MOOCs,Collective attention; LMOOCs; language MOOCs; learning analytics,,"Learning analytics (LA) has the potential to generate new insights into the complexities of learning behaviours in language massive open online courses (LMOOCs). In LA, the collective attention model takes an ecological system view of the dynamic process of unequal participation patterns in online and flexible learning environments. In this study, the 'Oral Communication for EFL Learners (spring)' on XuetangX was selected as an example with which to examine the allocation of learner attention in the context of LMOOCs. The open-flow network of collective attention was used to model the dynamics of learning behaviours to understand how different cohorts of second language (L2) learners allocated their attention at the collective level. The results showed that what distinguished high-performing L2 learners was related less to where they started with LMOOC resources or how much attention they allocated to certain learning units and more to the extent to which their attention could be maintained and circulated into other learning units. In addition, learners' attention typically followed the pre-designed course structure each time they entered the online space. No learning resources offered in the selected LMOOC were found to dominate the collective attention flow, which suggested that L2 learners' online engagement followed classroom learning patterns. The use of LA to understand the allocation of L2 attention at the collective level provides new perspectives on digital behaviour in LMOOCs, which may facilitate the design of cost-effective L2 resources that prevent learner overload in the information-rich age.",2022
159,Input in the digital wild: Online informal and non-formal learning and their interactions with study abroad,complex systems; informal learning; non-formal learning; online learning; study abroad,,"As research into online informal language learning (OILL) develops as a field, the impact on such practices for a wide variety of contexts can be considered. In the case of this publication, the study abroad (SA) context is of particular interest. Indeed the study abroad student may interact with a range of online learning resources in formal, non-formal and informal contexts before during and after mobility. This review article looks at both Online Informal Language Learning and non-formal learning activities relevant to SA, with particular focus on the Erasmus + online learning support (OLS) platform and popular commercial non-formal learning apps such as Duolingo and Busuu. Such informal and non-formal learning activities also interact with formal language learning offered to SA students, some of which may also take place online. Formal, non-formal and informal learning can therefore be seen to constitute a personal learning environment (PLE) which is specific to each learner. Complex systems views of language learning, including usage based approaches and cognitive grammar, form a useful theoretical framework for understanding how second language (L2) skills may develop as learners are exposed to frequently occurring prototypes in salient contexts in input. While it is now widely accepted that such exposure has a significant impact on comprehension levels, research continues into individual differences between learners in terms of exposure time and cognitive, affective and linguistic engagement with the target materials. Data will be presented indicating that while formal and non-formal learning activities involve exposure times which are often insufficient for significant language development when taken in isolation, informal learning activities offer exposure times and forms of engagement which support language development for many learners. Issues surrounding the assessment and certification of linguistic skills gained outside the classroom are addressed in conclusion.",2023

One hundred L2 learners of English in Sri Lanka were divided into four experimental groups and control group: input flood, input enhancement, a specific instruction to pay attention to the target grammatical construction in the input, and an explicit metalinguistic explanation of the target construction. Eye tracking was used to collect data on the attentional processing of 45 participants in the sample. The eye-tracking measures of learners who received a specific instruction to pay attention to the target structure and an explicit metalinguistic explanation indicated increased attentional processing. The learners in these groups also improved their knowledge of the target structure significantly. The results suggest that increased attentional processing is needed for development in L2 grammatical knowledge and that explicit instruction to pay attention to the input and metalinguistic explanation are successful in directing learners' attentional resources toward novel grammatical constructions in the input.",2017

It informs about the outcome of a project, which the author conducted during a months-long research stay at the Danish company Ordbogen where he integrated its research and development (R&D) team. The first part of the project was to test machine translation and find out to what extent it is usable in the compilation of bilingual lexicographical databases. The hypothesis was that the technology was not yet mature. But surprisingly, it turned out that the accuracy rate is already so high that it is worth considering how to implement it. The second part of the project aimed at further developing an idea formulated by Fuertes-Olivera et al. (2018) on how to invert a dictionary without losing semantic content. The new vision is to compile a monolingual L2 database, bilingualize it to an L2-L1 database using machine translation, and then invert the relationship between L2 lemmata and L1 equivalents using the L1 definitions of the L2 lemmata as the axis. The third part of the project was to test this idea using a specially designed ad hoc program. The program automatically uploads relevant data from existing lexicographical databases, translates L2 definitions and example sentences into L1, suggests adequate L1 equivalents, and eventually inverts the relationship between the two languages. It worked, but the methodology still needs further refinement to be implementable on a large scale. The report concludes by listing some of the remaining challenges and defining the new role of the lexicographer in this type of project.",2022

Therefore, the purpose of this embedded mixed-methods study is to assess how three online feedback modes help improve student writing. Thirty-three intermediate Turkish-L1 learners of English received written, audio and screencast feedback in Google Drive to improve their writing in a multi-draft essay-writing task and an essay-revision task with three parallel essays. The results indicated that it was the audio group that made the highest number of correct revisions in the essay-writing task, while there was not a significant difference among the three feedback modes in the essay-revision task. Semi-structured interviews and screen recordings provided qualitative data about their preferences and how they worked with each mode to address both microlevel and macrolevel problems. The participants did not uniformly prefer a particular feedback mode but highlighted the potential benefits and downsides of each mode.",2020

Direct corpus approaches like data-driven learning (DDL) cultivate learner engagement and language discovery. However, second language writing (SLW) teachers face significant challenges using corpora in the classroom, and these challenges often go unaddressed in language teacher education, particularly for in-service teachers. This paper reports on a case study in which six university SLW teachers participated in an online corpus-based pedagogy workshop. Teachers developed DDL activity plans and wrote in reflective diaries. The analysis of these artifacts shows that the teachers tended to follow one of two paths toward knowledge integration, as either Planners or Seekers, when implementing corpus activities in their classrooms. The teachers also reported increased confidence in applying direct corpus methods to their lessons by the end of the workshops, though they expressed the need for continued, long-term support.",2023

Using conversation analysis for the examination of screen-recorded dyadic interactions, this study identifies a range of practices participants draw on to alert co-participants to incipient suspensions of talk. By accounting for such suspensions as being task-related through verbal alerts, typically in the form let me/let's X, participants successfully 'buy time', which allows them to fully concentrate on their screen activity and thereby ensure the progression of task accomplishment. We discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of the complex ecologies of technology-mediated interactions.",2022

Nowadays, the use of online resources combined with traditional strategies is being widely adopted in education. The new scenario is outpacing theoretical frameworks and research results, and empirical data is needed to assess the effectiveness of new teaching modalities to promote learners' achievement. In the field of language teaching, there is a paucity of studies offering empirical data on the use of combined educational strategies. The current paper aims to investigate the effect of WebQuests in two settings -Traditional (face-to-face) classes and flipped learning classes- on improving English listening skills and decreasing L2 listening anxiety. The study adopts a quasi-experimental design, with 96 participants of preparatory education learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Egypt. Three groups were selected randomly: The first experimental group used WebQuests in flipped learning; the second experimental group studied with WebQuests in a traditional (face-to-face) setting; and the control group studied through regular teaching with no WebQuests. A pre-test was used to assess students' L2 listening competence in the three groups. After the intervention, a post-test was given to the three groups to explore the improvement in their listening skills. Additionally, a pre-and-post foreign language listening anxiety questionnaire was used to check the effect of WebQuests on decreasing listening anxiety in the English classroom. The results showed that WebQuests are efficient strategies in teaching English, but the results are more significant in flipped learning.",2023

This study aimed at scrutinizing how the revised anonymous multi-mediated writing model fits emergency remote teaching (ERT), ensuring the promotion of academic integrity. The revised model was implemented throughout a two-semester freshmen Writing Skills course via a mixed methods triangulation research design in the ELT department of a university in Turkiye. Quantitative data came from writing assignments and peer feedback analyses, whereas qualitative data were retrieved through reflection papers and interviews. Students' ERT scores were compared to pre-Covid face-to-face (F2F) learning scores, revealing no significant differences; confirming that students' performances were similar in F2F or ERT without any increase in academic misconduct in ERT. The AMMW model worked well in ERT by enabling scaffolding through asymmetrical and symmetrical asynchronous online feedback, with the integration of a rubric as the learning tool. Qualitative findings revealed the limitations of online teaching, especially regarding the importance of teacher-student(s) interaction.

Study 1 aimed to develop a scale to measure the frequency of learners' voluntary, informal, out-of-school engagement with English, so-called Extramural English (EE) activities. It involved three stages - pilot study, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis - followed by measuring the test-retest reliability and known-groups validity of the scale. L2 English learners (N = 907; mean age: 17) from Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) and Turkey participated. The analyses led to a 32-item EE Scale that loaded onto eight factors: EE Digital Creativity, Gaming, Internalized, Music, Niche Activities, Reading and Listening, Social Interaction, and Viewing. Study 2, in which the scale was implemented, aimed to explore the frequency of EE activities and examined whether EE predicts learners' perceived speaking ability in different settings. Learners from Scandinavia (N = 197) and Asia (N = 125; China and Turkey) participated. Data analyses showed that both samples engaged most frequently in EE Music, Viewing and Reading and Listening. Ordinal regression analysis revealed that EE predicts perceived speaking ability in both contexts, but differently so. Thus, EE seems to play different roles for learning English in the different settings. Implications are discussed regarding the context-specific nature of EE.",2023

It differs from previous studies in that the EI task focuses on a single grammatical feature and time on task is strictly controlled. Seventy-three EFL learners and 20 native English speakers completed the EI and four other tests hypothesized as measures of implicit or explicit L2 knowledge. Factor analytic results indicated that learners' EI scores loaded on the factor labeled implicit L2 knowledge, confirming previous findings. Results from other tests and methodological issues concerning EI design and use suggest that the construct validation of EI as a measure of implicit L2 grammatical knowledge awaits further investigation.",2015

Thirty Korean middle school English language learners were randomly assigned to an interactive e-book reading (treatment) group or a paper-based reading (control) group. A pre-test and five comprehension tests were administered to both groups over a total of six reading sessions. A survey was also conducted to investigate students? perceptions of how helpful interactive e-book features were in aiding their reading comprehension. Results from the reading comprehension test scores showed no statistical differences between the groups across the five tests. Analysis of literal and inferential questions also showed no significant difference overall. Findings from the survey data along with researcher observation notes suggest that interactive features that are not designed to aid students? understanding can distract students from the task of reading which may hinder their comprehension.

With a growing interest in collaborative writing and collaborative reading, spurred on by the broader awareness of sociocultural theory and the collaborative nature of digital technologies, we proposed an innovative task collaborative reading for writing (CRW) and implemented it with pre-service language teachers of diverse L1s in the U.S. The students jointly read and annotated journal articles via the social annotation tool Perusall and then co-constructed OASIS summaries based on the reading. This study examines how the students employ comprehension strategies during collaborative reading/annotating; how they develop genre knowledge and attend to form during collaborative writing; and how they perceive CRW tasks. Data collected included the Perusall annotations, recorded pair talk, and reflection papers. Results showed that online CRW positively impacted learning by engaging learners in collectively expanding their reading strategies and enhancing genre knowledge and attention to form. CRW afforded mutual scaffolding and reading for a purpose. We posit that CRW tasks can have immense potential in diverse academic learning contexts where L2 writers are present. Future research is desired to examine the long-term effects of CRW on the development of L2 literacy skills and explore the potential of CRW tasks among different learner populations in other educational settings.",2023

A total of 120 Chinese university students of English as a foreign language (EFL) were randomly assigned to four task conditions: (1) reading; (2) reading + gap-fill; (3) reading + writing; and (4) reading + writing with the use of a digital dictionary. The Vocabulary Knowledge Scale was adapted to measure condition effects. The Metacognitive Awareness Inventory was used to examine learners' metacognitive knowledge and regulation. Results revealed that the group of learners who completed reading + writing tasks with the use of a digital dictionary demonstrated the best performance in acquiring receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge, followed by the reading + writing group, the reading + gap-fill group, and, finally, the reading only group. Multiple regression analysis supported the predictive effects of metacognitive regulation on task-based vocabulary learning.

Participants (N=138, aged 9-11) received explicit information followed by either task-essential practice in making form-meaning connections (referential activities from Processing Instruction) OR task-essential practice in spotting the form (word noticing activities). Both interventions yielded equivalent durable gains across six ecologically valid tests of comprehension and production (written and oral modalities), compared to no gains in a control group. The findings revealed that, following explicit information, input practice requiring engagement with the target feature (as proposed by Svalberg 2012) was equally effective as task-essential form-meaning connection practice, shedding important light on previous claims in the research agenda on task-essential input practice (Marsden 2006; Marsden and Chen 2011).

Due to the fact that memes can help learners leverage semiotic modes in social contexts, they hold great potential for language education. Integrating ecological social semiotic frameworks, this comparative case study examined the semiotic affordances of using memes for language learning in the digital wilds, with a focus on self-identified highly-motivated learner-memers in a university-level student-run Chinese-English intercultural chat group. Data sources included meme artifacts, screen shots, and recordings of meme-related communicative practices as well as semi-structed interviews with each participant. Analysis suggests there were four affordances perceived and utilized by the participants, including linking learners to emergent semiotic repertoires, L2 user agency, increased motivation, and personhood development. Key to learners' experiences was their awareness of perceived semiotic affordances and their agency to participate in meaning making for potentially meaningful learning experiences. We conclude with pedagogical implications for integrating the rich semiotic resources of memes into language classrooms.",2023
180,Context Synthesis Accelerates Vocabulary Learning Through Reading: The Implication of Distributional Semantic Theory on Second Language Vocabulary Research,,2ND LANGUAGE; ACQUISITION; GLOSSES,"Abstarct Besides explicit inference of word meanings, associating words with diverse contexts may be a key mechanism underlying vocabulary learning through reading. Drawing from distributional semantic theory, we developed a text modification method called reflash to facilitate both word-context association and explicit inference. Using a set of left and right arrows, learners can jump to a target word's previous or subsequent occurrences in digital books to synthesize clues across contexts. Participants read stories with target words modified by reflash-only, gloss-only, gloss + reflash, or unmodified. Learning outcomes were measured via Vocabulary Knowledge Scale and a researcher-developed interview to probe word-context association. We modeled the learning trajectories of words across five weeks among three adolescent L2 English learners (113 word-learner pairings) using Bayesian multilevel models. We found that reflash-only words made more gains than words in other conditions on both outcomes, controlling for key covariates such as types of existing knowledge. Our analysis also revealed that context synthesis may be particularly useful for learning specific types of words like homonyms, which has significant pedagogical implications.",2023

The results show that: (1) an increase of perceived interpreting difficulty led to a decrease in the overt visual attention and physical effort invested in note-taking, and a longer time to make note-taking decisions; (2) although the professionals and students reported a similar level of interpreting difficulty, the professionals devoted more overt visual attention and physical effort to completing the note-taking activity in interpreting than the students; and (3) the cognitive effort of note-taking was not affected by changes in source speech difficulty or interpreter work experience. These findings indicate that: (1) interpreting experience accumulation does not entail reductions in task-difficulty perception or the cognitive effort of note-taking but increases the amount of effort interpreters devote to note-taking; and (2) increased task difficulty affects time management during note-taking but not the cognitive effort of note-taking.",2023

An eye-tracking and pen-recording study",consecutive interpreting (CI) performance; note-taking; note-reading; features of notes; eye-tracking; pen-recording,TRANSLATION; DIFFICULTY,"This paper explores relationships between consecutive interpreting (CI) performance on the one hand, and interpreters' note-taking effort, note-taking product and note-reading effort, on the other hand. 20 pro-fessionals and 29 students consecutively interpreted two easy segments and two difficult segments in an English (L2) speech, with their eye fixations on the notes and handwriting on the digital pad being registered through eye-tracking and pen-recording methods. Both groups' CI performance showed positive but weak correlations with their note quantities in the easy segments, but not in the difficult ones. Almost no significant correlations were found between the students' interpretation quality and effort of note -taking, whereas the professionals' CI performance was negatively correlated with their cognitive effort of note-taking. Significant but weak correlations were observed in both groups between their note-reading effort and interpreting performance, but the students' correlations were mainly found in the difficult segments, and the professionals' correlations were mostly detected in the easy ones. Overall, the in-terpreters' note-taking behaviour was not closely associated with their interpretation quality, and the as-sociations varied across interpreter groups and task difficulties. These findings suggest that note-taking should be taught more judiciously in interpreter training programs and applied more prudently in interpreting practice.",2022
183,Polymedia repertoires of networked individuals A day-in-the-life approach,blended linguistic ethnography; device attention; mobile messaging; polymedia; repertoire,DIGITAL DISCOURSE; SOCIAL MEDIA; IDEOLOGIES; LANGUAGE; ONLINE,"This article introduces the concept of the polymedia repertoire to explore how social meaning is indexed through the interplay of communicative resources at different levels of expression (from choice of media to individual signs) in digitally mediated interactions. The multi-layered polymedia repertoire highlights how people move fluidly between media platforms, semiotic modes and linguistic resources in the course of their everyday interactions, and enables us to locate digital communications within individuals' wider practices. The potential of our theoretical contribution is illustrated through analysis of mobile phone messaging between participants in a large multi-sited ethnography of the communicative practices of multilingual migrants working in linguistically diverse UK city neighbourhoods. Our analysis of mobile messaging exchanges in a day-in-the-life of these networked individuals reveals the importance of device attention in shaping interpersonal interactions, as well as the complex ways in which choices at different levels of a polymedia repertoire are structured by social relationships, communicative purpose and (dis)identification processes.",2021
184,A Further Look into the Use of a Dictionary APP in EFL Writing: A Replication Study,REPLICATION; DICTIONARY USE; EFL WRITING; WRITING PERFORMANCE; LEXICAL SOPHISTICATION; LOOKUP PATTERNS,FORM; RETENTION,"The study replicated the experiment by Chen and Liu (2022), investigating the effect of dictionary use on EFL writing. It involved the same research variables as the original study except for adopting a different dictionary. Sixty-two English majors took two writing tests, one without dictionary assistance, the other with access to a mobile phone dictionary application which features a combination of an L1-L2 and an L2-L1 dictionary for bidirectional search. The application can keep a record of users' search inputs and entry clicks. A questionnaire was also conducted to survey the students' evaluation of the dictionary application. Different from the negative results found by the original study, the replication revealed a non-significant effect of dictionary use on writing performance, providing solid evidence that a better dictionary leads to fewer consultation errors, although the improvement in writing scores brought about by dictionary use was only marginal. The study confirmed the original finding about the positive impact of dictionary use on lexical sophistication. It also identified some differences in dictionary lookup patterns between the participants of the replication and the original study in terms of search frequency, preference for language search, preference for search items, and use of source dictionaries. The implications of the study for dictionary making are discussed.",2023

Using intentionally designed classroom activities to promote meaningful learning with a mobile application, we investigated the extent to which students of Spanish as a second language (L2) could improve accuracy in conjugating verbs. Pre- and posttest results show that these activities helped students improve not only accuracy but also confidence in conjugating Spanish verbs. The 80 students who participated in this study for four consecutive semesters reported an overall positive experience with the verb-conjugating activities but noted some limitations. Results of this empirical study enhance the learning of Spanish with a mobile application in the classroom.",2016

The aim of this study is to gain insight into the difficulties that advanced learners of Spanish as a foreign language for professional communication purposes experience when they have to perform a reading-to-write task. This insight will help to improve writing instruction and training for this particular type of students. In this study, 19 students of a one-year master's programme in multilingual professional communication (level B2-C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, Council of Europe, 2001) were asked to carry out a reading-to-write task in Dutch, their mother tongue, and in Spanish at the beginning of the academic year. This task was repeated at the end of the academic year. On both occasions, the task was writing an informative synthesis of approximately 200-250 words using three digital source texts in Dutch and in Spanish pertaining to different text genres (i.e., a report from the European Union, a website, a newspaper article). The three source texts varied in lexical and syntactical complexity, content, style and discursive characteristics. All written products were evaluated by two independent raters. We found no general improvement in the reading-to-write task between the two moments, neither in the L1 nor in the L2. We did not find an improvement at sentence, text, or discourse level either. We will explore several explanations for this lack of improvement, based on theoretical models of foreign language acquisition and recent empirical writing research.",2018

While empirical studies have demonstrated that digital game-based interactions offer valuable opportunities for FL practice and learning (e.g., Sundqvist & Wikstrom, 2015), little is known about the specific dynamics of FL use that facilitate FL learning. The present exploratory case study examined three Arabic learners' game-based FL use when playing the Arabic simulation-management video game Baalty. The study was framed by an ecological approach to FL learning, and data were collected through gaming journals, interviews, observations, and think-aloud protocol. Findings revealed that a number of specific dynamics including engagement, active FL use, and embodied meaning motivated, promoted, and scaffolded FL practice in the course of gameplay. Pedagogical and research implications are discussed.",2019
189,Using conference submission data to uncover broad trends in language teaching: A case study of one conference over 30 years,Conference data; JALT National conference; meta-analysis; review study; second language teaching; trends in language teaching,L2 INSTRUCTION,"Submissions to conferences can provide rich material for analysing characteristics and trends within a conference's history and that of similar conferences, as well as the associated field at large. The present study uses data gathered over 30 years from a language teachers' conference in Japan (JALT National) to expound upon patterns related to (1) strands and themes, (2) methodological and topical trends over time, (3) influential researchers, and (4) how JALT compares to other major language teaching conferences. The findings emerged from frequency counts, keyword searches and a detailed analysis of JALT's digital archive, which focused on presenters' abstract titles and abstracts consisting of a one-million-plus-word corpus. Beyond the content analysis of the conference under study, the use of the review study as a method for a broader understanding of how conferences both reflect and impact the field is discussed.",2013
190,Immersive Virtual Reality for Pragmatics Task Development,,DATA-COLLECTION METHODS; FORMULAIC EXPRESSIONS; DIGITAL GAME; TECHNOLOGY,"This study intends to contribute to the methodological debate into L2 pragmatics research by examining the usability of immersive virtual reality (VR) for developing a pragmatics task. The study compared participants' speech act performance between two closed role-play tasks using different mediums: computer-based and VR-based. Sixty-two native and nonnative speakers of English completed both tasks eliciting speech acts (requests, refusals, and opinions). The impact of task medium was assessed on oral fluency and use of speech act strategies. Both groups spoke more slowly and used more modification devices in the VR-based speech acts; However, the directness level of the main speech act strategies was similar between the two task mediums. In the speech act situations involving a large social distance, unequal power relationship and a high degree of imposition, speech rates were slower and the use of modifications was greater than those involving a small social distance, equal power relationship and a low degree of imposition. While the native speaker group used fewer direct strategies in the former situation type regardless the task medium, the nonnative speaker group was less direct in the former situation type in the VR condition only.",2022
191,Interactional patterns in the online language classroom: a quantitative analysis across proficiency levels and lesson types,Online language learning; interaction; classroom management; interactional patterns; Spanish Language Teaching (SLT),FEEDBACK; STUDENTS,"Online second language instruction has boomed in recent years, aided by technological affordances and the forced changes in instructional modality resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This transformation has underscored the critical role of interaction in online pedagogy. Research suggests that increasing opportunities for interaction between students and instructors is essential for fostering second language acquisition (SLA). However, little research exists quantifying the production of diverse types of interaction in online language instruction, particularly among experienced instructors. The present study utilizes an interactionist framework to perform a quantitative analysis of interaction in online Spanish language coursework, categorized according to interaction initiation type: Instructor-Prompted Participation (IPP), Unprompted Oral Participation (UOP), Unprompted Text Participation (UTP), i.e., chat usage, and interaction length (as exhibited by both the number of student turns in an interaction and the average length of those turns). Data includes 18 h of video recordings of synchronous L2 Spanish language instruction across proficiency levels and lesson types at a distance-learning university in the UK. Lesson types included grammar workshops and exam preparation. Results show that the interactional patterns in online language courses are influenced by proficiency level and lesson type. Lower proficiency students engaged in interaction routines more frequently, while the ability to engage in extended discourse was contingent upon the specific activity/lesson type. The study helps address the dearth of research on interaction and language teaching in languages other than English (LOTE).",2023
192,Between learning and playing? Exploring learners' perceptions of corrective feedback in an immersive game for English pragmatics,game-based learning; second language acquisition; feedback; error correction; learners' perceptions; intrinsic motivation,L2 GRAMMAR; IMPLICIT; RECASTS; ACQUISITION; INSTRUCTION; CLASSROOM; SLA,"This paper aims to provide a rationale for the utility of corrective feedback (CF) in digital games designed for language learning, with specific reference to learners' perceptions. Explicit and elaborate CF has the potential to increase learners' understanding of language, but might not be found useful in a game-based learning environment where the primary focus for the learner is on meaningful interaction and experiential learning. Also, as CF can be perceived as a measure of performance, it could harm learners' perception of competence. Eighty-three learners of English as a foreign language participated in a mixed-method experimental study that aimed to first explore the perceived usefulness of, and preferences for, explicit and implicit CF in an immersive educational game, and to secondly chart the relation between learners' perceptions of CF as they pertain to three individual difference factors related to learners' self-perception, namely intrinsic goal orientation, perceived competence and game experience. Survey and interview data showed that CF was found to be generally useful. A regression model indicated that the three measures of self-perception affected learners' perceptions of explicit CF positively, and that there was no impact on perceptions of implicit CF. Further, learners reported having enjoyed the implicit CF, although they did not find it particularly useful for learning. These findings indicate that the type of CF should be considered in the design of effective and enjoyable educational games.",2012

However, to date, it is unknown how these peer interactions involving heritage language learners contribute to written texts. Further, given the rise of social technologies in educational settings, a need exists to examine how interactions in digital platforms affect the production of written texts. To address these issues, 13 heritage-second language learner and 16 heritage-heritage learner pairs enrolled in advanced Spanish content courses completed two distinct versions of writing tasks. Participants were instructed that they were hired as business consultants for clothing and cellphone companies in Spain. While each participant wrote her or his own version, the pairs had to interact to compose formal business letters in Spanish to the CEO of each company justifying the hiring (Task A) or laying off (Task B) of employees. The main results first revealed that heritage-heritage pairs produced more syntactically complex business letters, as evidenced by a greater ratio of syntactic subordination along with a minor trend of greater morphosyntactic accuracy. Second, synchronous computer-mediated communication interactions led to a higher production of syntactic coordination, especially for the heritage-second language pairs. Findings are discussed in light of the interplay between learner factors and task environment.",2023
194,Zwara (Zuwrah) Berber,,,"Zwara Berber is a variety of Nafusi (ISO 639-3; Lewis, Simons & Fennig 2016) which belongs to the eastern Zenati group within northern Berber (where Berber is the scientific term for Tamazight), a branch of Afro-Asiatic. Zwara (Zuwrah, Zuwara, Zura, Zuara, Zouara) is a coastal city located at 32.9 degrees N, 12.1 degrees E in Libya. The speakers refer to themselves as /at 'wil.lul/ (also /ajt 'wil.lul/) those of Willul' and to their specific variety of the language as /t.'wil.lult/ the language of Willul'. Having no official status during the Italian colonization of Libya and the first period after the country's independence in 1951, repression of the language became severe after the Cultural Revolution of 1973. Its propagation through teaching and the media fell under a constitutional ban on the denial of the Arab identity of the state, and qualified as such as treason, a capital offense. Until the revolution of 2011 (17 February'), the language was therefore not spoken in cultural, educational or governmental domains and could not be taught, printed or broadcast. The number of Tamazight speakers in Libya is estimated at 184,000 in Lewis et al. (2016) and at 560,000 by Chakel & Ferkal (2012). In the absence of a municipal register, the number of inhabitants in Zwara is uncertain. A conservative estimate is between 50,000 and 100,000, which is also the number of speakers of the Zwara variety. Other than through exposure by radio and television, children learn Arabic only from age six, when attending school. Speakers have variable L2 Arabic competence depending on exposure to the language.",2018
195,Mobile Augmented Reality and Language-Related Episodes,,COLLABORATIVE DIALOGUE; DIGITAL GAMES; LEARNERS; ENGLISH; WORLD; L2; PLACE; PAIR; WILLINGNESS; PROFICIENCY,"Applications of locative media (e.g., place-based mobile augmented reality [AR]) are used in various educational content areas and have been shown to provide learners with valuable opportunities for investigation-based learning, location-situated social and collaborative interaction, and embodied experience of place (Squire, 2009; Thorne & Hellermann, 2017; Zheng et al., 2018). Mobile locative media applications' value for language learning, however, remains underinvestigated. To address this lacuna, this study employed the widely used construct of language-related episodes (LREs; Swain & Lapkin, 1998) as a unit of analysis to investigate language learning through participation in a mobile AR game. Analysis of videorecorded interactions of four mixed-proficiency groups of game players (two English language learners [ELLs] and one expert speaker of English [ESE] per group) indicates that LREs in this environment were focused on lexical items relevant to the AR tasks and physical locations. Informed by sociocultural theory and conversation analysis, the microgenesis of learners' understanding and subsequent use of certain lexical items are indicated in the findings. This understanding of new lexical items was frequently facilitated by ESEs' assistance and the surrounding physical environment. A strong goal orientation by both ESEs and ELLs was visible, providing implications for task-based language teaching approaches.",2019

In the choice and use of learning materials and approaches, I argue for the consideration of current research in second language acquisition (SLA), with particular importance being studies on sociocultural/pragmatic and multilingual practices, the application of usage-based and complex dynamic models of language learning, and the evidence of the viability of informal language learning. Those developments inform an ecological approach to computer-assisted language learning (CALL), which stresses the openness and unpredictability of the process through the organic interplay between learner and environment. The column concludes with a plea for a greater role for second language development as a vital contribution to the development of global citizenry.",2021
