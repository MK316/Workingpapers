Dear Ms. Burke,
Thank you for your question about how to donate 
children’s books for our book drive. The event will take 
place for one week from September 10th to 16th. Books can 
be dropped off 24 hours a day during this period. There are 
two locations designated for donations: Adams Children’s 
Library and Aileen Community Center. At each location, 
there are blue donation boxes at the main entrance. If you 
are unable to visit these locations, books can be mailed 
directly to our organization. Your donations will help support 
children in our community who may not be able to afford 
books. We hope this information makes your donation 
easier. We appreciate your support.
Best regards,
Carrie Wells

‘How much farther to the finish line? Can I make it?’ Emma 
felt pain in her legs and was breathing heavily. She couldn’t 
remember ever being so exhausted. Feeling frustrated, she 
began to think about giving up on the race. She knew she 
would regret it later, but it seemed like there was nothing she 
could do. Then, she remembered a strategy she had learned. By 
having strong imagery control, she could help herself achieve 
her goal. Over and over, Emma imagined herself running 
smoothly and breathing easily. It was working! She started to 
feel better. About thirty minutes later, she found herself 
crossing the finish line with a big smile on her face. Surrounded 
by cheering friends, she enjoyed her victory full of joy.

Life is hectic. Our days are filled with so many of the “have tos” 
that we feel there’s no time left for the “want tos.” Further, 
spending all our time with others doesn’t give us the ability to 
hit the reset button and relax. Leaving little to no time for 
ourselves or for the things that are important to us can lead to 
unmanaged stress, frustration, fatigue, resentment, or worse, 
health issues. Building in regular “you time,” however, can provide 
numerous benefits, all of which help to make life a little bit 
sweeter and a little bit more manageable. Unfortunately, many 
individuals struggle with reaching goals due to an inability to 
prioritize their own needs. Alone time, however, forces you to take 
a break from everyday responsibilities and the requirements of 
others so you can dedicate time to move forward with your 
own goals, meet your own personal needs, and further explore 
your personal dreams.
* hectic: 매우 바쁜
① 자신을 위한 시간을 확보하여 원하는 바를 추구할 필요가 있다.
② 타인과의 정기적인 교류를 통해 스트레스를 해소해야 한다.
③ 자신의 분야에서 성공하려면 체계적인 시간 관리가 중요하다.
④ 개인의 이익과 공공의 이익 간의 조화를 이루어야 한다.
⑤ 업무의 우선순위는 동료와 협의하여 정해야 한다.

21. 밑줄 친 “a link in a chain, a phase in a process”가 다음 글에서 
의미하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]
Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi suggests that the 
common idea of a creative individual coming up with great 
insights, discoveries, works, or inventions in isolation is wrong. 
Creativity results from a complex interaction between a person 
and his or her environment or culture, and also depends on 
timing. For instance, if the great Renaissance artists like 
Ghiberti or Michelangelo had been born only 50 years before 
they were, the culture of artistic patronage would not have been 
in place to fund or shape their great achievements. Consider 
also individual astronomers: Their discoveries could not have 
happened unless centuries of technological development of the 
telescope and evolving knowledge of the universe had come 
before them. Csikszentmihalyi’s point is that we should devote 
as much attention to the development of a domain as we do to 
the people working within it, as only this can properly explain 
how advances are made. Individuals are only “a link in a chain, 
a phase in a process,” he notes.
* patronage: 보호, 후원, 찬조
① Individuals’ creativity results only from good fortune.
② Discoveries can be made only due to existing knowledge.
③ One’s genius is a key element of a series of breakthroughs.
④ Individuals receive no credit for their creative achievements.
⑤ Individual creativity emerges only in its necessary conditions.

Consumers like a bottle of wine more if they are told it cost 
ninety dollars a bottle than if they are told it cost ten. Belief that 
the wine is more expensive turns on the neurons in the medial 
orbitofrontal cortex, an area of the brain associated with 
pleasure feelings. Wine without a price tag doesn’t have this 
effect. In 2008, American food and wine critics teamed up with 
a statistician from Yale and a couple of Swedish economists to 
study the results of thousands of blind tastings of wines ranging 
from $1.65 to $150 a bottle. They found that when they can’t 
see the price tag, people prefer cheaper wine to pricier bottles. 
Experts’ tastes did move in the proper direction: they favored 
finer, more expensive wines. But the bias was almost 
imperceptible. A wine that cost ten times more than another was 
ranked by experts only seven points higher on a scale of one to 
one hundred.

1950s critics separated themselves from the masses by 
rejecting the ‘natural’ enjoyment afforded by products of mass 
culture through judgments based on a refined sense of realism. 
For example, in most critics championing Douglas Sirk’s films’ 
social critique, self-reflexivity, and, in particular, distancing 
effects, there is still a refusal of the ‘vulgar’ enjoyments 
suspected of soap operas. This refusal again functions to divorce 
the critic from an image of a mindless, pleasure-seeking crowd 
he or she has actually manufactured in order to definitively 
secure the righteous logic of ‘good’ taste. It also pushes 
negative notions of female taste and subjectivity. Critiques of 
mass culture seem always to bring to mind a disrespectful 
image of the feminine to represent the depths of the corruption 
of the people. The process of taste-making operated, then, to 
create hierarchical differences between the aesthete and the 
masses through the construction of aesthetic positions contrary 
to the perceived tasteless pleasures of the crowd.
* vulgar: 저속한, 서민의  ** aesthetic: 미학의, 심미적인
① critics’ negative view on popular tastes and its effects
② criticism of cultural hierarchy in soap operas and films
③ side effects of popularized cultural products on crowds
④ resistance of the masses to cultural separations and its origins
⑤ critics’ tendency to identify the refined tastes of the masses
24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Radioactive waste disposal has become one of the key 
environmental battlegrounds over which the future of nuclear 
power has been fought. Environmentalists argue that no system 
of waste disposal can be absolutely safe, either now or in the 
future. Governments and the nuclear industry have tried to find 
acceptable solutions. But in countries where popular opinion is 
taken into consideration, no mutually acceptable solution has 
been found. As a result, most spent fuel has been stored in the 
nuclear power plants where it was produced. This is now 
causing its own problems as storage ponds designed to store a 
few years’ waste become filled or overflowing. One avenue that 
has been explored is the reprocessing of spent fuel to remove the 
active ingredients. Some of the recovered material can be 
recycled as fuel. The remainder must be stored safely until it has 
become inactive. But reprocessing has proved expensive and 
can exacerbate the problem of disposal rather than assisting it. 
As a result, it too appears publicly unacceptable.
* exacerbate: 악화시키다
① Are Nuclear Power Plants Really Dangerous?
② How to Improve Our Waste Disposal System
③ No Benefits: Nuclear Power Plants Are Deceiving Us
④ An Unresolved Dilemma in Dealing with Nuclear Waste

Victor Borge, born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1909, was a 
comedian and pianist. Initially a concert musician, Victor Borge 
soon developed a performance style that combined comedy 
with classical music. When the Nazis invaded Denmark in 
1940, he was performing in Sweden, and a short time later 
managed to escape to America. When he arrived in the U.S., he 
didn’t speak a word of English. Learning English by watching 
movies, he soon managed to translate his jokes for the American 
audience. In 1948, Victor Borge became an American citizen 
and a few years later was offered a show of his own, Comedy in 
Music. The show remains the longest-running one-man show in 
Broadway history. At the age of 90, he still performed 60 times 
a year. He died on December 23rd, 2000 at his home in 
Greenwich, Connecticut, U.S.

Not all organisms are able to find sufficient food to survive, 
so starvation is a kind of disvalue often found in nature. It 
also is part of the process of selection ① by which biological 
evolution functions. Starvation helps filter out those less fit to 
survive, those less resourceful in finding food for ② themselves 
and their young. In some circumstances, it may pave the way 
for genetic variants ③ to take hold in the population of a species 
and eventually allow the emergence of a new species in place of 
the old one. Thus starvation is a disvalue that can help make 
④ possible the good of greater diversity. Starvation can be of 
practical or instrumental value, even as it is an intrinsic 
disvalue. ⑤ What some organisms must starve in nature is 
deeply regrettable and sad. The statement remains implacably 
true, even though starvation also may sometimes subserve ends 
that are good.

For every toxic substance, process, or product in use today,

waiting to be discovered through the application of human 
intellect, ingenuity, and effort. In almost every case, the safer 
alternative is (A) available / unavailable  at a comparable cost.

cost of acting, but history sets the record straight. The 
chemical industry denied that there were practical alternatives 
to ozone-depleting chemicals, (B) predicting / preventing  not 
only economic disaster but numerous deaths because food and 
vaccines would spoil without refrigeration. They were wrong. 
The motor vehicle industry initially denied that cars caused air 
pollution, then claimed that no technology existed to reduce

to reduce air pollution would make cars extremely expensive. 
They were wrong every time. The pesticide industry argues that

31. Among the most fascinating natural temperature-regulating 
behaviors are those of social insects such as bees and ants. 
These insects are able to maintain a nearly constant temperature 
in their hives or mounds throughout the year. The constancy of 
these microclimates depends not just on the location and 
insulation of the habitat, but on 
. 
When the surrounding temperature increases, the activity in 
the hive decreases, which decreases the amount of heat 
generated by insect metabolism. In fact, many animals decrease 
their activity in the heat and increase it in the cold, and people 
who are allowed to choose levels of physical activity in hot or 
cold environments adjust their workload precisely to body 
temperature. This behavior serves to avoid both hypothermia 
and hyperthermia.
* insulation: 단열  ** hypothermia: 저체온(증)  *** hyperthermia: 고체온(증)
① the activity of the insects in the colony
② the interaction with other species
③ the change in colony population
④ the building materials of the habitat
⑤ the physical development of the inhabitants
32. Although most people, including Europe’s Muslims, have 
numerous identities, few of these are politically salient at any 
moment. It is only when a political issue affects the welfare of 
those in a particular group that 
. 
For instance, when issues arise that touch on women’s rights, 
women start to think of gender as their principal identity. 
Whether such women are American or Iranian or whether they 
are Catholic or Protestant matters less than the fact that they 
are women. Similarly, when famine and civil war threaten 
people in sub-Saharan Africa, many African-Americans are 
reminded of their kinship with the continent in which their 
ancestors originated centuries earlier, and they lobby their 
leaders to provide humanitarian relief. In other words, each issue 
calls forth somewhat different identities that help explain the 
political preferences people have regarding those issues. [3점]
* salient: 두드러진
① identity assumes importance
② religion precedes identity
③ society loses stability
④ society supports diversity
⑤ nationality bears significance

33. Food unites as well as distinguishes eaters because what 
and how one eats forms much of one’s emotional tie to a 
group identity, be it a nation or an ethnicity. The famous 
twentieth-century Chinese poet and scholar Lin Yutang 
remarks, “Our love for fatherland is largely a matter of 
recollection of the keen sensual pleasure of our childhood. The 
loyalty to Uncle Sam is the loyalty to American doughnuts, 
and the loyalty to the Vaterland is the loyalty to Pfannkuchen 
and Stollen.” Such keen connection between food and national 
or ethnic identification clearly indicates the truth that cuisine 
and table narrative occupy a significant place in the training 
grounds of a community and its civilization, and thus, eating, 
cooking, and talking about one’s cuisine are vital to 
. In other words, the destiny 
of a community depends on how well it nourishes its members.
* nourish: 기르다
① an individual’s dietary choices
② one’s diverse cultural experiences
③ one’s unique personality and taste
④ a community’s wholeness and continuation
⑤ a community’s dominance over other cultures
34. Modern psychological theory states that the process of 
understanding is a matter of construction, not reproduction, which 
means that the process of understanding takes the form of the 
interpretation of data coming from the outside and generated by 
our mind. For example, the perception of a moving object as a 
car is based on an interpretation of incoming data within the 
framework of our knowledge of the world. While the interpretation 
of simple objects is usually an uncontrolled process, the 
interpretation of more complex phenomena, such as interpersonal 
situations, usually requires active attention and thought. 
Psychological studies indicate that it is knowledge possessed 
by the individual that determines which stimuli become the 
focus of that individual’s attention, what significance he or she 
assigns to these stimuli, and how they are combined into a larger 
whole. This subjective world, interpreted in a particular way, 
is for us the “objective” world; we cannot know any world 
other than 
. [3점]
① the reality placed upon us through social conventions
② the one we know as a result of our own interpretations
③ the world of images not filtered by our perceptual frame
④ the external world independent of our own interpretations
⑤ the physical universe our own interpretations fail to explain

While the transportation infrastructure may shape where we 
travel today, in the early eras of travel, it determined whether 
people could travel at all. ① The development and improvement 
of transportation was one of the most important factors in 
allowing modern tourism to develop on a large scale and 
become a regular part of the lives of billions of people around 
the world. ② Another important factor was the industrialization 
that led to more efficient transportation of factory products to 
consumers than ever before. ③ Technological advances provided 
the basis for the explosive expansion of local, regional, and 
global transportation networks and made travel faster, easier, 
and cheaper. ④ This not only created new tourist-generating 
and tourist-receiving regions but also prompted a host of other 
changes in the tourism infrastructure, such as accommodations. 
⑤ As a result, the availability of transportation infrastructure 
and services has been considered a fundamental precondition 
for tourism.

Most of us have a general, rational sense of what to eat 
and when ― there is no shortage of information on the 
subject.
(A) Emotional eating is a popular term used to describe eating 
that is influenced by emotions, both positive and negative. 
Feelings may affect various aspects of your eating, 
including your motivation to eat, your food choices, 
where and with whom you eat, and the speed at which 
you eat. Most overeating is prompted by feelings rather 
than physical hunger.
(B) Yet there is often a disconnect between what we know and 
what we do. We may have the facts, but decisions also 
involve our feelings. Many people who struggle with 
difficult emotions also struggle with eating problems. 
(C) Individuals who struggle with obesity tend to eat in 
response to emotions. However, people who eat for 
emotional reasons are not necessarily overweight. People 
of any size may try to escape an emotional experience by 
preoccupying themselves with eating or by obsessing over 
their shape and weight. [3점]

Ever since the first scientific opinion polls revealed that 
most Americans are at best poorly informed about politics, 
analysts have asked whether citizens are equipped to play 
the role democracy assigns them.
(A) Such factors, however, can explain only the misinformation 
that has always been with us. The sharp rise in 
misinformation in recent years has a different source: our 
media. “They are making us dumb,” says one observer. 
When fact bends to fiction, the predictable result is 
political distrust and polarization.
(B) It’s the difference between ignorance and irrationality. 
Whatever else one might conclude about self-government, 
it’s at risk when citizens don’t know what they’re talking 
about. Our misinformation owes partly to psychological 
factors, including our tendency to see the world in ways 
that suit our desires.
(C) However, there is something worse than an inadequately 
informed public, and that’s a misinformed public. It’s one 
thing when citizens don’t know something, and realize it, 
which has always been a problem. It’s another thing when 
citizens don’t know something, but think they know it, 
which is the new problem.

Moreover, more than half of Americans age 18 and older

Both the budget deficit and federal debt have soared 
during the recent financial crisis and recession. ( ① ) During 
2009－2010, nearly 40 percent of federal expenditures were 
financed by borrowing. ( ② ) The huge recent federal deficits 
have pushed the federal debt to levels not seen since the years 
immediately following World War II. ( ③ ) The rapid growth 
of baby-boomer retirees in the decade immediately ahead will 
mean higher spending levels and larger and larger deficits for 
both Social Security and Medicare. ( ④ ) All of these factors 
are going to make it extremely difficult to slow the growth of 
federal spending and keep the debt from ballooning out of 
control. ( ⑤ ) Projections indicate that the net federal debt 
will rise to 90 percent of GDP by 2019, and many believe it 
will be even higher unless constructive action is taken soon.

We become entrusted to teach culturally appropriate 
behaviors, values, attitudes, skills, and information about 
the world.
Erikson believes that when we reach the adult years, several 
physical, social, and psychological stimuli trigger a sense of 
generativity. A central component of this attitude is the desire 
to care for others. ( ① ) For the majority of people, parenthood 
is perhaps the most obvious and convenient opportunity 
to fulfill this desire. ( ② ) Erikson believes that another 
distinguishing feature of adulthood is the emergence of an 
inborn desire to teach. ( ③ ) We become aware of this desire 
when the event of being physically capable of reproducing is 
joined with the events of participating in a committed 
relationship, the establishment of an adult pattern of living, and 
the assumption of job responsibilities. ( ④ ) According to 
Erikson, by becoming parents we learn that we have the need to 
be needed by others who depend on our knowledge, protection, 
and guidance. ( ⑤ ) By assuming the responsibilities of being 
primary caregivers to children through their long years of 
physical and social growth, we concretely express what Erikson 
believes to be an inborn desire to teach. [3점]

Perceptions of forest use and the value of forests as 
standing timber vary considerably from indigenous peoples 
to national governments and Western scientists. These 
differences in attitudes and values lie at the root of 
conflicting management strategies and stimulate protest 
groups such as the Chipko movement. For example, the 
cultivators of the Himalayas and Karakoram view forests as 
essentially a convertible resource. That is, under increasing 
population pressure and growing demands for cultivable 
land, the conversion of forest into cultivated terraces means 
a much higher productivity can be extracted from the same 
area. Compensation in the form of planting on terrace edges 
occurs to make up for the clearance. This contrasts with the 
national view of the value of forests as a renewable 
resource, with the need or desire to keep a forest cover over 
the land for soil conservation, and with a global view of 
protection for biodiversity and climate change purposes, 
irrespective of the local people’s needs.

As a couple start to form a relationship, they can be seen to 
develop a set of constructs about their own relationship and, 
in particular, how it is similar or different to their parents’ 
relationship. The couple’s initial disclosures involve them 
forming constructs about how much similarity there is 
between them and each other’s families. What each of them 
will remember is selective and (a) coloured by their family’s 
constructs system. In turn it is likely that as they tell each 
other their already edited stories, there is a second process of 
editing whereby what they both hear from each other is again 
(b) interpreted within their respective family of origin’s 
construct systems. The two sets of memories ― the person 
talking about his or her family and the partner’s edited 
version of this story ― go into the ‘cooking-pot’ of the 
couple’s new construct system. Subsequently, one partner 
may (c) randomly recall a part of the other’s story as a tactic 
in negotiations: for example, Harry may say to Doris that she 
is being ‘bossy ― just like her mother’. Since this is probably 
based on what Doris has told Harry, this is likely to be a very 
powerful tactic. She may protest or attempt to rewrite this 
version of her story, thereby possibly adding further material 
that Harry could use in this way. These exchanges of stories 
need not always be (d) employed in such malevolent ways. 
These reconstructed memories can become very powerful, to 
a point where each partner may become confused even about 
the simple (e) factual details of what actually did happen in 
their past.
* malevolent: 악의 있는

(A)
Over the last week, Jason had been feeling worried about 
his daughter, Sally. For two months now, Sally had been 
absorbed, perhaps even excessively, in studying birds. He 
was afraid she might begin to ignore her schoolwork. While 
shopping, Jason was glad to run into his old friend Jennifer, a 
bird expert working at the local university. Maybe (a) she 
could help ease his concern. Upon hearing about Sally’s 
interest, Jennifer invited them both to visit her office to see 
just how deep Sally’s fascination was.
(B)
Approaching the tree, Sally shouted excitedly, “There, 
that’s the nest!” Jennifer looked up to see a small cup-shaped 
nest within a fork of the branches. Quickly, (b) she took out 
her binoculars and peered where Sally pointed. In the fading 
evening light, she found the two rare black birds in their nest. 
“See, didn’t I tell you?” exclaimed Sally. Looking at her in 
joyful surprise, both Jason and Jennifer were proud of Sally. 
They now recognized her extraordinary gift and passion as a 
bird-watcher.
* binoculars: 쌍안경
(C)
Two days later, Jason and Sally visited Jennifer’s office. 
Sally was delighted by the books about birds and she joyfully 
looked at the beautiful pictures in them. It was while Jason 
and Jennifer were talking that Sally suddenly shouted, “Oh, 
I’ve seen this bird!” “Impossible,” replied Jennifer, not 
believing it. “This book shows rare birds. You can’t see any 
of them around here.” But (c) she insisted, “I spotted a pair of 
them in their nest in a huge oak tree nearby!”
(D)
Jennifer walked up to Sally and took a close look at the 
page. (d) She calmly said, “That’s the black robin of Chathas 
Island. It’s one of the rarest birds, Sally. You couldn’t have 
seen it in this town.” Yet Sally persisted. “In that case, can 
you show (e) me the nest?” asked Jennifer. “Yes, I can right 
now if you want,” answered Sally full of confidence. Jennifer 
put on her coat, pulled out a pair of binoculars, and stepped 
out. Sally and Jason followed.
