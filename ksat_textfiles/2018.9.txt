A tear rolled down Lindsay’s cheek. She thought she had 
put her favorite toy, Blue Bunny, in her bag before school this 
morning. She had ‘show and tell’ in class today, and she was 
anxious. Her teacher, Mrs. Cline, might be angry that she had 
forgotten to bring it. She quickly searched the classroom and 
checked her bag one more time. Her precious Blue Bunny 
was a gift from her father, who worked overseas. It was 
nowhere to be found. Just then, Mrs. Cline appeared in the 
doorway. “Mrs. Cline!” Lindsay cried. “I can’t find my toy to 
show in class today. I’m sorry!” Mrs. Cline smiled gently. She 
was holding the toy. “Oh, Mrs. Cline! Thank you. I thought I 
had lost Blue Bunny!” Lindsay felt calm and comforted now 
that she had her toy again.

20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Once you start to see praise for what it is ― and what it 
does ― these constant little evaluative outbursts from adults 
start to produce the same effect as fingernails being dragged 
down a blackboard. You begin to root for a child to give his 
teachers or parents a taste of their own treacle by turning 
around to them and saying (in the same saccharine tone of 
voice), “Good praising!” Still, it’s not an easy habit to break. 
It can seem strange, at least at first, to stop praising; it can 
feel as though you’re being chilly or withholding something. 
But that, it soon becomes clear, suggests that we praise more 
because we need to say it than because children need to hear 
it. Whenever that’s true, it’s time to rethink what we’re doing. 
What kids do need is unconditional support, love with no 
strings attached. That’s not just different from praise ― it’s 
the opposite of praise.
* treacle: 당밀, 달콤한 것
① 아이들을 칭찬하는 습관을 그만두어야 한다.
② 아이들의 눈높이에 맞는 조언을 해 주어야 한다.

⑤ 아이들에게 감정을 솔직하게 표현하는 방법을 가르쳐야 한다.

21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
People sometimes make downward social comparisons ―
comparing themselves to inferior or worse-off others ― to feel 
better about themselves. This is self-enhancement at work. 
But what happens when the only available comparison target 
we have is superior or better off than we are? Can 
self-enhancement motives still be served in such situations? 
Yes, they can, as captured by the self-evaluation maintenance 
model. According to this theory, we shift between two 
processes ― reflection and comparison ― in a way that lets us 
maintain favorable self-views. In areas that are not especially 
relevant to our self-definition, we engage in reflection, 
whereby we flatter ourselves by association with others’ 
accomplishments. Suppose you care very little about your 
own athletic skills, but when your friend scores the winning 
goal during a critical soccer match, you beam with pride, 
experience a boost to your self-esteem, and take delight in 
her victory celebrations as if, by association, it were your 
victory too.
* flatter: 치켜세우다, 아첨하다
① 타인과의 비교를 통해 자신에 대한 객관적 평가를 할 수 있다.
② 자기 분야와 관련 없는 사람들의 성공도 축하해 줄 필요가 있다.
③ 성취도가 낮은 사람들과의 비교는 자기발전에 도움이 되지 않는다.
④ 사람들은 성취도가 높은 사람과 자신을 비교하지 않는 경향이 있다.
⑤ 타인의 성취를 자신과 연결하여 긍정적인 자아상을 유지할 수 있다.
22. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Some psychologists believe that insight is the result of a 
restructuring of a problem after a period of non-progress where 
the person is believed to be too focused on past experience and 
get stuck. A new manner to represent the problem is suddenly 
discovered, leading to a different path to a solution heretofore 
unpredicted. It has been claimed that no specific knowledge, or 
experience is required to attain insight in the problem situation. 
As a matter of fact, one should break away from experience 
and let the mind wander freely. Nevertheless, experimental 
studies have shown that insight is actually the result of 
ordinary analytical thinking. The restructuring of a problem 
can be caused by unsuccessful attempts in solving the problem, 
leading to new information being brought in while the person 
is thinking. The new information can contribute to a 
completely different perspective in finding a solution, thus 
producing the Aha! Experience.
* heretofore: 지금까지
① disadvantages of experience in creative thinking
② significance of analytical thinking in gaining insight
③ contribution of insight in forming a new perspective
④ necessity of separating insight from analytical thinking
⑤ difficulty of acquiring in-depth knowledge from experience
23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
When consumers lack adequate information to make 
informed choices, governments frequently step in to require 
that firms provide information. In the United States, we are all 
familiar with the mandatory nutritional information placed on 
food products. The Securities and Exchange Commission that 
monitors American stock markets forces firms to meet certain 
reporting requirements before their stock can be listed on 
exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. Such 
reporting helps ensure that private investors have reliable 
information on which to base their investment decisions. 
Often, however, these regulations do not work adequately, as 
the Enron scandal in 2001 clearly illustrates. The oil trading 
company Enron had cooked its books to overstate its 
profitability in its mandated reports. One outcome of Enron’s 
subsequent financial collapse was the introduction of new 
regulations designed to improve the reliability of the 
information that companies must provide to the public.
* mandatory: 의무적인  ** subsequent: (결과로서) 일어나는
① Financial Advice for Better Market Profitability
② The Emergence of New Business Opportunities
③ Ethical Stock Investment for Reliable Businesses
④ Disclosing Truth: The Push for Market Credibility
⑤ Inflated Figures: The Driving Force for Investment

The above graph shows the number of multipurpose 
industrial robots per 10,000 employees in 2011 for six selected 
countries. ① All of the six countries have more multipurpose 
industrial robots per 10,000 employees in automotive 
industries than in all other industries. ② Among the countries 
in the graph, Japan has the largest number of multipurpose 
industrial robots per 10,000 employees in automotive 
industries. ③ While the Republic of Korea has the smallest 
number of multipurpose industrial robots per 10,000 
employees in automotive industries, it has the largest number 
in all other industries. ④ Both the USA and the United 
Kingdom have more than 600 units of multipurpose industrial 
robots per 10,000 employees in automotive industries but 
have fewer than 200 units in all other industries. ⑤ Among the 
six countries in the graph, Japan, Italy, and Germany are the 
top three countries for the number of multipurpose industrial 
robots per 10,000 employees in automotive industries.

25. brown tree snake에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 
것은?
The brown tree snake has a large head with sticking-out 
eyes. The head is distinct from the narrow neck. Its body 
usually has a light brown background with a series of darker 
markings or bands on it. The snake is about 38 centimeters 
when it comes out of its egg, and usually reaches 1 to 2 
meters long. This snake is infamous for causing the extinction 
of the majority of native bird species in Guam. Shortly after 
World War Ⅱ, the brown tree snake was accidentally brought 
into Guam from its native range in the South Pacific, 
probably as an unwanted passenger on a ship or plane. It is 
not hunted or eaten by any other animals in Guam and is 
therefore at the top of its food chain, which has led the snake 
to increase dramatically in number.
① 큰 머리와 돌출된 눈을 가지고 있다.
② 일반적으로 몸 바탕색은 연한 갈색이다.
③ 알에서 나올 때 약 38센티미터이다.
④ 제2차 세계 대전 이전에 Guam으로 우연히 유입되었다.
⑤ Guam에서 먹이 사슬의 최상위에 있다.

28. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
The lack of real, direct experience in and with nature has 
caused many children to regard the natural world as mere 
abstraction, that fantastic, beautifully filmed place ① filled 
with endangered rainforests and polar bears in peril. This 
overstated, often fictionalized version of nature is no more 
real ― and yet no less real ― to them than the everyday nature 
right outside their doors, ② waits to be discovered in a child’s 
way, at a child’s pace. Consider the University of Cambridge 
study which found that a group of eight-year-old children was 
able to identify ③ substantially more characters from animations 
than common wildlife species. One wonders whether our 
children’s inherent capacity to recognize, classify, and order 
information about their environment ― abilities once essential 
to our very survival ― is slowly devolving to facilitate life in 
④ their increasingly virtualized world. It’s all part of ⑤ what 
Robert Pyle first called “the extinction of experience.”
* peril: 위험  ** devolve: 퇴화하다

적절한 것은? [3점]
Why does the “pure” acting of the movies not seem 
unnatural to the audience, who, after all, are accustomed in 
real life to people whose expression is more or less indistinct? 
Most people’s perception in these matters is not very sharp. 
They are not in the habit of observing closely the play of 
features of their fellow men ― either in real life or at the 
movies. They are (A) disappointed / satisfied with grasping 
the meaning of what they see. Thus, they often take in the 
overemphasized expression of film actors more easily than any 
that is too naturalistic. And as far as lovers of art are concerned, 
they do not look at the movies for imitations of nature but for 
art. They know that (B) artistic / real representation is always 
explaining, refining, and making clear the object depicted. 
Things that in real life are imperfectly realized, merely hinted 
at, and entangled with other things appear in a work of art 
complete, entire, and (C) free / inseparable from irrelevant 
matters. This is also true of acting in film.
* entangle: 얽히게 하다
(A)
(B)
(C)
① disappointed …… artistic …… free
② disappointed …… real
…… free
③ satisfied
…… artistic …… inseparable
④ satisfied
…… real

⑤ satisfied

Most of us probably parent the way we were parented. 
Louise, a mother who attended my seminars, shared how 
① her mother dealt with sibling fighting. Louise said her 
mother’s infamous threat was always, “If you kids don’t stop 
fighting, ② I’m going to knock your three heads together!” 
Louise and her siblings were always puzzled about the 
specifics of how their mother would actually accomplish such 
a task, which, thankfully, ③ she never attempted. But what 
drove her mother to make this empty threat? Extreme 
annoyance with the sibling arguments, probably. No doubt, 
Louise’s mother had learned this threatening tactic from 
④ her own mother, and, in the absence of any other parenting 
tools she knew of, she said it to her own children, regardless 
of whether it worked. If Louise had not learned the effective 
parenting skills taught in the seminars, ⑤ she would probably 
be using similarly ineffective threatening techniques with her 
own children today!
* sibling: 형제(의), 자매(의)

31. One unspoken truth about creativity ― it isn’t about wild 
talent so much as it is about 
. To find a few 
ideas that work, you need to try a lot that don’t. It’s a pure 
numbers game. Geniuses don’t necessarily have a higher 
success rate than other creators; they simply do more ― and 
they do a range of different things. They have more successes 
and more failures. That goes for teams and companies too. 
It’s impossible to generate a lot of good ideas without also 
generating a lot of bad ideas. The thing about creativity is that 
at the outset, you can’t tell which ideas will succeed and 
which will fail. So the only thing you can do is try to fail 
faster so that you can move onto the next idea.
* at the outset: 처음에
① sensitivity
② superiority
③ imagination
④ productivity
⑤ achievement
32. Let me spend a moment on the idea of adjusting to another 
person’s mental orientation. What I mean is this. At any moment, 
a person has a 
. The 
person notices this rather than that, and she has feelings and 
makes judgements about one rather than another aspect of 
events. If she is hungry, for example, she may notice that a 
shop is selling groceries; her friend may notice only that it sells 
newspapers. If she is short of money, she may resent that the 
fruit is overpriced; meanwhile her friend may feel tempted by 
some juicy peaches. In one sense the two friends are 
experiencing the same shop and its contents, but they are 
having quite different experiences of that shop. A more 
extreme case arises when one person comprehends things in a 
peculiar and individual way, for instance, in mistaking the shop 
for a cinema. [3점]
① desire to make better choices
② point of view similar to that of others
③ personal preference on where to shop
④ particular take on what is happening
⑤ tendency to stick to traditions

33. Externalization is the foundation from which many 
narrative conversations are built. This requires a particular 
shift in the use of language. Often externalizing conversations 
involve tracing the influence of the problem in a child’s life 
over time and how the problem has disempowered the child 
by limiting his ability to see things in a different light. The 
counsellor helps the child to change by deconstructing old 
stories and reconstructing preferred stories about himself and 
his life. To help the child to develop a new story, the 
counsellor and child search for times when the problem has 
not influenced the child or the child’s life and focus on the 
different ways the child thought, felt and behaved. These 
 help the 
child create a new and preferred story. As a new and preferred 
story begins to emerge, it is important to assist the child to 
hold on to, or stay connected to, the new story. [3점]
① exceptions to the problem story
② distances from the alternative story
③ problems that originate from the counsellor
④ efforts to combine old and new experiences
⑤ methods of linking the child’s stories to another’s
34. The narratives that people create to understand their 
landscapes come to be viewed as marketable entities and a 
source of income for residents. Landscapes with a strong 
place identity have an advantage in marketing to tourists, as it 
is relatively easy to compartmentalize and market their 
narratives. Such places may have disadvantages as well, 
however. If place identity is tied to a particular industry, local 
residents may feel strongly attached to the definitions of place 
that stem from involvement in that industry, and they may 
 in favor of one based 
on a tourism industry. People rooted in landscape may feel 
strong connections to other community members and may 
resent the invasion of outsiders who they believe are different 
and challenge their common identity. Finally, local residents 
may feel that this process reduces their identities to mere 
commercial transactions, and they may believe they sacrifice 
what is unique and special about their place. [3점]
* entity: 실재  ** compartmentalize: 구획하다  *** transaction: 거래
① resist losing that identity
② stop persisting with the old tie
③ tolerate the shift of that industry
④ alienate themselves from that place
⑤ refuse the advantage of that industry

One of the hallmarks of evaluating the quality of a black tea 
is by assessing how tightly the leaves are rolled. Generally, 
higher-graded teas are teas with leaves that are tightly and 
uniformly rolled. ① Lower-graded teas, on the other hand, are 
teas with leaves that are loosely and inconsistently rolled. 
② With that said, the tightness of the roll has more to do with 
the steepability of a leaf than it does with the taste of a tea. 
③ The rolling of leaves is done by machine or, sometimes, by 
hand to break the cell walls of the leaves and release 
essential oils. ④ Therefore, one should not evaluate the tea’s 
drinkability or taste merely because its leaves are not tightly 
rolled. ⑤ It is common to find that people prefer the taste of 
looser rolled black teas over more expensive or more highly 
graded black teas that have been tightly rolled.
* hallmark: 특징, 특질  ** steepability: (차를) 우려낼 수 있음

It has been said that eye movements are windows into 
the mind, because where people look reveals what 
environmental information they are attending to. However, 
there is more to attention than just moving the eyes to look 
at objects. 
(A) You may have had this experience if you have been 
reading a book and then suddenly become aware that 
although you were moving your eyes across the page 
and “reading” the words, you had no idea what you had 
just read.
(B) Even though you were looking at the words, you 
apparently were not paying attention. There is a mental 
aspect of attention that involves processing that can 
occur independently of eye movements.
(C) We can pay attention to things that are not directly in our 
line of vision, as evidenced by the basketball player who 
dribbles down court while paying attention to a teammate 
off to the side, just before she throws a perfect pass 
without looking. We can also look directly at something 
without paying attention to it.

Today the term artist is used to refer to a broad range of 
creative individuals across the globe from both past and 
present. This rather general usage erroneously suggests 
that the concept or word “artist” existed in original contexts.
(A) Inventions, ideas, and discoveries have been credited to 
the persons who originated them. This view is also at the 
core of the definition of an “artist.” Artists are perceived 
to establish a strong bond with their art to the point of 
combining into one “entity.”
(B) In contrast to the diversity it is applied to, the meaning of 
this term continues to be mostly based on Western views 
and values. Since the fifteenth century, this tradition has 
been concerned with recognizing individual achievements.
(C) Art history has reinforced this oneness: A painting by 
Pablo Picasso is called “a Picasso.” This union between 
artists and their work has determined the essential qualities 
of an artist: originality, authorship, and authenticity. [3점]

But the examination of the accuracy of information 
obtained in this manner is not a simple matter.
The one area in which the Internet could be considered an 
aid to thinking is the rapid acquisition of new information. 
( ① ) But this is more fictional than real. ( ② ) Yes, the 
simple act of typing a few words into a search engine will 
virtually instantaneously produce links related to the topic at 
hand. ( ③ ) What one often gets is no more than abstract 
summaries of lengthy articles. ( ④ ) As a consequence, I 
suspect that the number of downloads of any given scientific 
paper has little relevance to the number of times the entire 
article has been read from beginning to end. ( ⑤ ) My advice 
is that if you want to do some serious thinking, then you’d 
better disconnect the Internet, phone, and television set and try 
spending twenty-four hours in absolute solitude.

But it is no light matter to quickly and correctly pen a long 
and complicated composition. 
There are many instances of rapid work on the part of the 
great composers; and their facility and quickness of 
composition causes great wonder and admiration. ( ① ) But 
our admiration is often misdirected. ( ② ) When we hear of 
some of the speedy writing of great works by Mozart or 
Mendelssohn, we might think that this speed was of the 
composing power as well as of pen, but, in fact, such was 
seldom the case. ( ③ ) These great musicians generally did 
their composition mentally without reference to pen or piano, 
and simply postponed the unpleasant manual labor of 
committing their music to paper until it became absolutely 
necessary. ( ④ ) Then they got credit for incredible rapidity 
of composition. ( ⑤ ) One has only to copy a piece of music 
or to try to put into notes some piece of music previously 
memorized, to realize this. [3점]

The weakness of local networks lies in their 
self-containment, for they lack input as well as outreach. In 
a classic study of urban politics, Herbert Gans found that 
neighborhoods with the highest levels of solidarity often 
were unable to block unfavorable policies and programs for 
lack of ties to possible allies elsewhere in the city. It was for 
this reason that Gans referred to them as “urban villagers.” 
As the opposite of local networks, cosmopolitan networks 
offer little solidarity and have little capacity to comfort and 
sustain members. But members benefit from a constant 
flow of new information and from the great reach of their 
influence, even if it tends to be somewhat lacking in 
strength. Local networks tend to be small. In contrast, 
cosmopolitan networks can be huge. Thus, while the 
“urban villagers” lacked ties even to their local city 
government, cosmopolitan network ties often lead into the 
White House.

An ecosystem that is altered or damaged in some way will 
be out of balance with the biome for that area. For example, 
if the local biome is forest, but the trees have been removed 
from one area, then the ecosystem is out of balance. The 
natural tendency is for plant species to move into that area, 
bringing the ecosystem back towards the biome state. The 
spread of a species into a new area is called colonisation. It 
can happen naturally only if there are ecologically healthy 
ecosystems nearby to provide plant seeds. Once the 
vegetation has started to recover, insects, birds and other 
animals will travel into the newly regenerated area.
These processes of ecological colonisation can be 
supported by environmental 
. For example, 
we are currently seeing important changes in the way 
agriculture is carried out in Britain. Rather than just 
maximising food production, farming is becoming more 
environmentally friendly, with the support of financial 
subsidies. This new approach increases biological diversity 
by conserving hedges and the wildflowers, insects, birds and 
other animals that live on the land. A proportion of 
agricultural land is left completely uncultivated so that 
species can gradually colonise it. This provides a habitat for 
a wider range of species. Leaving some farmland as 
set-aside is also a way to decrease overall production when 
that is economically desirable. Note that set-aside land is 
more permanent than fallow land, which is usually left for 
only a year. Colonisation is a slow process, taking place over 
years or even decades.

(A)
An important lesson to remember is that we should try to 
see the positives in life even while we are stuck in the 
middle of trouble. Riccardo, who was named after his father, 
an immigrant from Mexico, learned this lesson at a young 
age. Although the family called him Ricky, his father had his 
own nickname for him: Good-for-Nothing. Why did the 
elder Riccardo call (a) him that? Because Ricky hated 
fishing.
(B)
The nation came to know Ricky as the most complete 
player of his generation, and he was voted into the Hall of 
Fame. And his father, the elder Riccardo, what did he think 
about it? Though he had wanted all of his sons to join the 
family business, he was finally proud of Ricky and respected 
his accomplishments. Ricky held onto hope in one of the 
most difficult moments of (b) his life and achieved 
greatness.
(C)
Since these jobs were not fishing, his father saw no value 
in them. Young Ricky hated fishing. Everything would be 
fine if it were not fishing, he thought to himself. Soon, Ricky 
began to follow his older brother who used to play sandlot 
ball. For Ricky, playing baseball with (c) him was a way to 
forget his hardship. Fortunately, Ricky was very good at it, 
and was treated like a hero among his playmates. When 
Ricky was sixteen, he decided to drop out of school to 
become a baseball player. And by the time he was through 
with baseball, (d) he had become a legend.
* sandlot ball: 동네야구
(D)
His father saw this very negatively, because he was a 
fisherman. He loved the fishing business. So did all of his 
sons, except for Good-for-Nothing Ricky. The boy did not 
like being on the boat, and the smell of fish made him sick. 
Instead, Ricky ― who was not afraid of hard work ―
delivered newspapers, shined shoes, worked in the office, and 
even repaired nets. (e) His income went to the family. Even 
so, his father was strongly dissatisfied with him and still 
always said that he was good for nothing.
